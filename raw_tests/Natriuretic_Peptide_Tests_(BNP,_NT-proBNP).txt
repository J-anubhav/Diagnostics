The meaning of your test results will depend on your age, sex, medical history, family history, and the results of other tests. Ask your provider to explain what the results of your BNP or NT-proBNP test say about your health and how this information may affect your treatment.
A BNP or NT-proBNP test alone can't diagnose the cause of your symptoms. But in general, if you have symptoms that could be caused by heart failure:
Normal results on a BNP or NT-proBNP usually mean that you're unlikely to have heart failure. Your provider may order other tests to find out what's causing your symptoms.
If you have obesity, your weight may affect the accuracy of your test results, making your levels lower than they really are. If your provider suspects heart failure, you may have other heart health tests even if your BNP or NT-proBNP levels are normal.

Higher than normal levels of BNP or NT-proBNP mean that you could have heart failure. Your provider will probably order other heart health tests to help make a final diagnosis.
In most cases, the higher the level of your test results, the more serious your heart failure may be. But other health conditions can increase BNP and NT-proBNP levels. That's why your medical history is important for understanding whether high test results mean you have heart failure.
Other conditions that can cause high levels of BNP and NT-proBNP include:
Kidney failure
Other types of heart disease, including conditions that affect your heart valves or heart muscle
Certain lung disorders, including a blood clot in your lung (pulmonary embolism) and high blood pressure in your lungs (pulmonary hypertension)
If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.
