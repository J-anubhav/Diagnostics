Your results will show the types of hemoglobin found and the levels of each.
Hemoglobin type levels that are too high or too low may be a sign of:
Thalassemia, a condition that affects the production of hemoglobin. In this condition, your body makes normal hemoglobin, but it doesn't make enough of it. Symptoms range from mild to severe.
Sickle cell trait. In this condition, you have one sickle cell gene and one normal gene. Most people with sickle cell trait do not have health issues. But you can pass the sickle cell gene on to their children.
Sickle cell disease.
Hemoglobin C disease, a condition that causes a mild form of anemia and sometimes an enlarged spleen and joint pain.
Hemoglobin S-C disease, a condition that causes a mild or moderate form of sickle cell disease.
Your results may also show whether a specific disorder is mild, moderate, or severe.
There are several options for treating thalassemia, anemia, sickle cell disease, and other hemoglobin disorders. Until recently, treatment options for sickle cell disease were limited. But now, new therapies have become available. If you or your child was diagnosed with a sickle cell disease or another hemoglobin disorder, talk to your provider about treatment options.
To understand the results of a hemoglobin electrophoresis test, your provider will consider your symptoms, medical history, and the results of other blood tests. Hemoglobin electrophoresis test results are often compared with other tests, including a complete blood count and a blood smear.
Let your provider know if you've had a blood transfusion in the last 12 weeks since this can affect your results.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your provider.
