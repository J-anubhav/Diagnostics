In most cases, your first test for trichomoniasis will check a sample of body fluid under a microscope to look for parasites. This test is called "wet prep microscopy." It's often done first because it's quick and inexpensive.
The results of a wet prep microscopy test will be either negative or positive:
A negative result means that no parasites were seen in your sample. But wet prep microscopy results aren't always accurate. So, if your provider thinks you have trichomoniasis, more accurate tests may be done on your sample. They include:

Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). These tests look for genetic material from the parasites that cause trichomoniasis.
Rapid antigen tests. These tests are only done on samples of vaginal fluid. They look for certain proteins, called antigens, from the parasite. Rapid antigen tests can be done at your provider's office. The results are usually ready in under 15 minutes.
Culture tests. For these tests, your sample is sent to a lab, where the cells will grow for up to a week. Then the sample will be checked under a microscope. If your sample had parasites, there will now be more of them, so they'll be easier to find.


A positive result means that parasites were found in your sample. You have a trichomoniasis infection. Your provider will prescribe medicine to cure the infection. Be sure to:

Finish all your medicine according to your provider's instructions.
Tell your recent sexual partners about your infection so they can get tested, too.
Let your provider know if you still have symptoms after treatment.
Get tested for other STIs.
To prevent any future trichomoniasis infections, take appropriate precautions whenever having sex. These include:
Having sex with only one partner who has tested negative for STIs and has sex only with you.
Using condoms correctly every time you have sex.
