Test Name: Blood Alcohol Level

--- CONTENT ---
Blood alcohol level results may be given in different ways, including percentage of blood alcohol content (BAC). The legal limit for BAC is usually 0.08%, but this limit is lower in certain states and for certain driver classifications. The effects of alcohol and your level of impairment increase as your BAC increases. Typical results are below.
0.01 to 0.05% BAC: You may feel relaxed, less alert, and have a slight loss of judgement.
0.06-.15% BAC: You may have slurred speech, reduced muscle coordination and impaired judgement, memory or balance.
0.16 to 0.30% BAC: In this range, you will feel more serious signs of intoxication such as difficulty walking and speaking. You may also feel drowsy, confused, and nauseated. You may experience gaps in memory (blackouts), vomiting or loss of consciousness.
Over 0.31% BAC: Levels are especially dangerous and may even be fatal. You may lose consciousness, have trouble breathing, or go into a coma.
The timing of this test can affect the accuracy of the results. A blood alcohol test can detect alcohol in your system for up to about 12 hours after your last drink. Other factors can also affect your BAC and your level of impairment, including:
Weight.
Age.
Sex.
Type of alcohol.
How quickly you drank.
How much you ate before you drank.
Medicines you're taking.
Sensitivity (tolerance) to alcohol.
If you have questions or concerns about your results, you may want to talk to a health care provider and/or a lawyer.
