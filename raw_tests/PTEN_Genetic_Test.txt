If you have cancer and your test results show you have an acquired change in your PTEN gene, your provider can explain what it means for your treatment plan and future health.
If your test results show that you have certain inherited changes in your PTEN gene, it means you have PHTS. It doesn't mean you have cancer. However, your risk of cancer may be higher than most people. Your provider may discuss steps you can take to reduce your cancer risk, including:
Having a yearly exam
Having frequent cancer screening tests to help find cancer early when it may be easier to treat
Making lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise, eating healthy foods, and quitting smoking
Taking medicine or having surgery (mastectomy) to reduce the risk of breast cancer
Having surgery (hysterectomy) to reduce the risk of uterine cancer
For children, your provider may recommend a yearly exam that includes a skin check. Yearly thyroid ultrasound tests may begin at age seven. Your child may also need a checkup to see how their brain and nervous system are developing.
