Your provider will use your test results, symptoms, and medical history to understand what your ammonia levels say about your health. Normal levels vary with age, but in general, low levels are normal and healthy.
If your test results are normal, your provider will order other tests to find out what's causing your symptoms.
If your test results show ammonia levels that are higher than normal, it usually means that your body is having trouble getting rid of ammonia. Many types of health conditions can cause high ammonia levels, including:
Liver diseases, such as cirrhosis or hepatitis
Hepatic encephalopathy
Kidney disease or kidney failure
Certain genetic disorders, including urea cycle disorders
Reye syndrome (most common in in children and teens)
Taking certain medicines
If the results of an ammonia levels test are high, more tests will usually be done to diagnose the cause. Treatment will depend on the condition that's causing the problem. If you have questions about your test results or treatment, talk with your provider.
