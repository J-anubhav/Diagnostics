Amniotic fluid may be tested for many different disorders. Your test results will depend on which tests your provider ordered.
Normal results are reported as "normal" or "negative." This means that it's very unlikely that your baby has the disorder that was tested, but it does not guarantee your baby will not have any health problems.
Results that are not normal are reported as "abnormal" or "positive." This means that your baby very likely has the disorder that was tested.
Your provider will explain your test results. Amniocentesis is very accurate, but in certain cases, your provider may order more tests to learn about your baby's health.
It may help to speak to a genetic counselor before testing and/or after you get your results. A genetic counselor is a specially trained professional in genetics and genetic testing who can help you understand what your results mean.
