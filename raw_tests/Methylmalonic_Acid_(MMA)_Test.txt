If your results show higher-than-normal levels of MMA, it may mean you have a vitamin B12 deficiency. The test can't show how much of a deficiency. To help make a diagnosis, your provider may compare your results with other tests including a homocysteine blood test and/or vitamin B tests.
Lower-than-normal levels of MMA are not common and are not considered a health problem.
If your baby has moderate or high levels of MMA, it may mean that they have methylmalonic acidemia. If it's not treated, it can cause life-threatening complications. If your baby is diagnosed with this disorder, talk to your child's provider about treatment options.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your provider. Your provider will consider your symptoms, medical history, and the results of other blood tests.
