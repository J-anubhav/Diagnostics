The results of a ceruloplasmin test alone cannot diagnose any conditions. The meaning of your test results will depend on the results of other tests, including tests that measure the amount of copper in your blood and/or urine.
To make a diagnosis, your provider will consider all your test results along with your symptoms, medical history, and family history. Ask your provider to explain what your ceruloplasmin levels say about your health.
In general, lower than normal ceruloplasmin levels may mean your body is not able to use copper properly. Low ceruloplasmin may be a sign of:
Wilson disease, although ceruloplasmin levels are sometimes normal with this disease
Menkes syndrome
Severe liver disease
Kidney disease
A lack of copper caused by malnutrition and/or malabsorption
Higher than normal ceruloplasmin levels may be linked to:
Heart disease
Rheumatoid arthritis
Leukemia
Hodgkin lymphoma
Infection, inflammation, or injury
But high levels of ceruloplasmin don't always mean you have a condition that needs medical treatment. Pregnancy, birth control pills, and certain medicines, including estrogen therapy to treat menopause, may cause high blood ceruloplasmin. Too much copper in your diet rarely causes high ceruloplasmin.
If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.
