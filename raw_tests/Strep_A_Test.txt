If the rapid test is positive, it means you or your child has strep throat or another strep A infection. No further testing will be needed.
If the rapid test is negative but the provider thinks you or your child might have strep throat, they may order a throat culture. If you or your child has not already provided a sample, you will get another swab test.
If the throat culture is positive, it means you or your child has strep throat or other strep infection.
If the throat culture is negative, it means your symptoms are not being caused by strep A bacteria. Your provider will probably order more tests to help make a diagnosis.
If you or your child is diagnosed with strep throat, you will need to take antibiotics. Most often you will need to take them for 10 days. After a day or two of taking the medicine, you or your child should start to feel better. Most people are no longer contagious after taking antibiotics for 24 hours. But it's important to take all the medicine as prescribed. Stopping early can lead to serious complications, such as:
Rheumatic fever
An abscess (pocket of pus) around the tonsils or in the back of the throat
Swollen lymph nodes in the neck
Sinus infections
Ear infections
People with strep throat should stay home from work, school, or daycare until they no longer have a fever and have taken antibiotics for at least 12-24 hours.
It's important to take the antibiotics as prescribed and to finish the medicine even if you start feeling better. If you stop taking them too soon, some bacteria may survive and re-infect you.
Someone who tests positive for strep throat but has no symptoms (called a "carrier") usually does not need antibiotics. They are less likely to spread the bacteria to others and very unlikely to have complications.
People can get strep throat more than once. Having strep throat does not protect someone from getting it again in the future. To prevent group A strep infections, you should:
Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Put your used tissue in the waste basket.
If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve or elbow.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
If soap and water are not available, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
Wash glasses, utensils, and plates after they are used, especially if the person who used them is sick.
Regularly clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects.
If you have questions about your results or your child's results, talk to your provider.
