A high homocysteine level may be a sign that:
You are not getting enough vitamin B12 or folic acid in your diet.
You (or your child) have homocystinuria. You will probably need more testing to rule out or confirm a diagnosis of homocystinuria.
You may have a higher risk of heart disease, stroke, or other blood vessel disorders.
Higher than normal homocysteine levels may also happen with other conditions, such as osteoporosis, chronic kidney disease, hypothyroidism, schizophrenia, or Alzheimer's disease or other types of dementia.
If your homocysteine levels are high, it doesn't always mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Your results may be affected by:
Your age. Homocysteine levels may get higher as you get older.
Your sex. Males usually have higher homocysteine levels than females, but levels in females increase after menopause.
Smoking.
If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.
