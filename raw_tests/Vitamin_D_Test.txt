Your test results may be reported as "total vitamin D," or as the amounts of vitamin D2 and vitamin D3. Vitamin D2 and D3 work about the same in your body. If you add vitamin D2 and D3 together, you get your total vitamin D. Total vitamin D is the important number to check.
Your test results will usually describe total vitamin D levels as:
Deficient, which means very low vitamin D levels that are likely to affect your bones and general health
Insufficient, which means low vitamin D levels that may weaken your bones and affect your health, even if you don't have symptoms
Sufficient or optimal, which means vitamin D levels that are enough for good bone and general health for most people
Toxic or possible toxicity, which means very high vitamin D levels that might cause health problems
If your total vitamin D levels are deficient or insufficient, it may mean you:
Don't get enough vitamin D from your diet and/or exposure to sunlight
Have trouble absorbing vitamin D from your food, which may be a sign of a malabsorption disorder
Have trouble changing vitamin D into a form your body can use, which may be a sign of kidney or liver disease
Take a medicine that affects vitamin D levels
To increase your vitamin D levels, your provider may recommend taking vitamin D supplements and/or eating more foods rich in vitamin D. This is usually safer than getting more sun, which may cause skin cancer.
If your total vitamin D levels are high or toxic, it usually means you're getting too much from supplements. You'll need to stop taking the supplements to reduce your vitamin D levels. That's because too much vitamin D can cause serious damage to your organs and blood vessels.
