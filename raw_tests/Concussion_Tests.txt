If concussion testing shows that a head injury has caused a concussion, the treatment is physical and mental rest to help the brain heal. This often includes limiting time spent on electronic screens (televisions, computers, phones, and tablets). It may also be necessary to take two or three days off from school or work.
Ask your provider about a recovery plan, including how to relieve symptoms. As symptoms improve, physical and mental activities can gradually be increased. But it's important to make sure that the concussion is fully healed before returning to all usual activities. That's because having a second concussion before the first has healed can cause serious brain damage. Your provider may do another concussion test to see if recovery is complete.
Complete healing is very important for athletes who want to return to their sport after a concussion. Different sports organizations may have "concussion protocols" that set guidelines for when an athlete can participate again after having a concussion.
