Results from Down syndrome screening tests show your risk of having a baby with Down syndrome:
A positive screening test result means that your baby's chance of having Down syndrome is higher than average. Your test results may include a number that describes how high the risk is. But a high risk doesn't mean your baby will have Down syndrome. You could still deliver a healthy baby with no chromosomal defects or disorders.
A negative/normal screening test result means that your baby is unlikely to have Down syndrome. But a screening test can't guarantee that your baby won't have Down syndrome.
Whether or not your screening tests were normal, you may choose to have one or more diagnostic tests. Diagnostic and karyotype tests can usually tell you whether or not your baby will have Down syndrome. But diagnostic tests cannot predict how much Down syndrome will affect your baby's health and abilities.
You may find it helpful to speak with a genetic counselor before testing and again after you get your results. Genetic counselors are specially trained to help you weigh the risks and benefits of testing. They can also help you understand what your results mean so you can make informed decisions.
