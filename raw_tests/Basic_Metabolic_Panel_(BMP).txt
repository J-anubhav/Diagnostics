If any one result or combination of BMP results were not normal, it could be a sign of several different health conditions. These include kidney disease, breathing problems , and complications from diabetes. You will likely need more tests to confirm or rule out a specific diagnosis.
To understand what your test results may mean, your provider may also consider your symptoms, your medical history, and the results of other tests you had. If you have questions about your results, talk to your provider.
