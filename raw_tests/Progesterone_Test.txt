The meaning of your test results depends on:
Why you were tested.
Where you were in your menstrual cycle when your blood sample was taken.
Whether or not you're pregnant.
High progesterone levels:
When you're not pregnant may be linked to:

A cyst on your ovaries.
Ovarian cancer.
Adrenal gland problems, including adrenal gland cancer, or an inherited disorder called congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).


Higher than expected progesterone levels when you are pregnant, may mean you're having two or more babies.
High progesterone levels may also be a sign of a molar pregnancy, which is an abnormal growth of tissue in the uterus. It's caused by a fertilized egg with such severe genetic problems that it   cannot become a fetus. The growth can turn into cancer and must be removed.
Low progesterone levels:
When you're not pregnant, may be linked to:

Not ovulating normally.
Not having a menstrual period (amenorrhea).
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition that causes missed periods and unpredictable ovulation.
High stress. Too much of the stress hormone cortisol can affect your body's ability to make progesterone.
Perimenopause. This is the time just before menopause.
Low cholesterol.


When you're pregnant, may be linked to:

Ectopic pregnancy.
Miscarriage or a high risk of miscarriage.
Pre-eclampsia.
