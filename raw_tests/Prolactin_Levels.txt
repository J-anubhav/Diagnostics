To understand what the results of your prolactin levels test mean, your provider will consider your symptoms, sex, and medical history, and the results of any other tests you had.
In general, for men and women who aren't pregnant or breastfeeding, higher-than-normal prolactin levels may be a sign of many types of conditions, such as:
Prolactinoma or another pituitary disorder.
A disease of the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is an area of the brain that controls the pituitary gland and other body functions.
Hypothyroidism.
Cirrhosis (scarring of the liver).
Kidney disease.
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in women.
If your results show high prolactin levels, your provider will usually order other blood tests to help diagnose the cause. If your provider thinks you may have a prolactinoma, you may also have an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan to check your pituitary gland for tumors.
Treatment for high prolactin levels depends on the cause. Treatment is usually medicine. Surgery may be needed for certain pituitary tumors.
Higher-than-normal prolactin levels don't always mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Diets high in protein and certain medicines can cause high levels. Small increases in prolactin may be caused by stress, exercise, and even having sex. So, depending on your symptoms and medical history, your provider may suggest testing you again to see if your prolactin levels remain high.
Lower-than-normal prolactin levels are rare but may be a sign of a pituitary disorder. Without enough prolactin, a woman may not make enough milk to breastfeed after birth. This is usually the only symptom of abnormally low prolactin levels.
If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.
