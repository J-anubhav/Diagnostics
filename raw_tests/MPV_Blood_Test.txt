An MPV test alone can't diagnose a health condition. Your provider will use your MPV results, platelet counts, and other test results to get a more complete picture of your health.
Newly made platelets are larger than older platelets. So looking at the average size of your platelets can provide information about whether your bone marrow is making a lot of new platelets.
With a high MPV test result, your platelets are larger than usual. This may mean that your older (smaller) platelets are being destroyed at an increased rate and your bone marrow is making many new platelets. That can be a sign of:
Thrombocytopenia, not having enough platelets
Myeloproliferative diseases, blood cancers in which the bone marrow makes too many platelets or other blood cells
Preeclampsia, a complication that usually starts after the 20th week of pregnancy and causes high blood pressure
Heart disease
Diabetes
Hemolytic anemia
With a low MPV test result, your platelets are smaller than usual. This may mean your bone marrow isn’t making enough new platelets. That can be a sign of:
Certain cancers
Side effects from certain medicines
Aplastic anemia
Autoimmune diseases
Bacterial or viral infections
Genetic conditions
Alcohol use disorder (AUD)
