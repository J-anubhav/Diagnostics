If your monospot test result is positive, it may mean you or your child has mono. If it is negative, but you or your child still have symptoms, your provider will probably order an EBV antibody test.
If the monospot test is negative, but you or your child still have symptoms, your provider will probably order an EBV antibody test.
If your EBV test is negative, it means you don't currently have an EBV infection and were never infected with the virus. A negative result means your symptoms are probably caused by another disorder.
If your EBV test is positive, it means EBV antibodies were found in your blood. The test will also show which types of antibodies were found. This allows your provider to find out whether you were infected recently or in the past.
While there is no cure for mono, you can take steps to relieve symptoms. These include:
Get plenty of rest
Drink lots of fluids
Suck on lozenges to soothe a sore throat
Take over-the-counter medicines for pain and fever. But don't give aspirin to children or teens because it may cause Reye syndrome, a serious, sometimes fatal, disease that affects the brain and liver.
Antibiotics are not used to treat mono. If you have a bacterial infection along with mono, you should not take penicillin antibiotics like ampicillin or amoxicillin. Otherwise, you may experience a reaction, such as a rash. If you have severe symptoms, your provider may suggest additional treatment based on which organs in your body are affected by the mono. Mono usually goes away on its own within a few weeks. Fatigue may last a bit longer.
Mono can cause an enlarged spleen, which could rupture and cause a medical emergency. To try to protect the spleen, providers recommend avoiding intense exercise and contact sports until you fully recover (about a month). If you have questions about your results or treatment for mono, talk to your provider.
