A normal lung function test result for you depends on the size of your lungs. Your lung size is based on your height, sex, and age. So, your provider will compare your test results to results from healthy people who are the same height, age, and sex as you.
If your results aren't normal, it may mean you have a lung condition. Lung function tests can't diagnose which specific lung disease you have. But your test results can tell which of the two main types you have:
Obstructive lung conditions cause your airways to become narrow, making it hard for air to flow out of your lungs. Examples of obstructive lung diseases include asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema.
Restrictive lung conditions decrease the amount of air your lungs can hold. This may happen if your lungs or your chest muscles can't expand fully when you breath in. Examples of restrictive lung conditions include scleroderma, sarcoidosis, pulmonary fibrosis, and interstitial lung diseases.
If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.
