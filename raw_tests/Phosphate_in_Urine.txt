The results of your phosphate test may say "phosphorus levels" or "phosphate levels." These terms mean the same thing. Your results may include guidelines for normal, low, and high levels, but your provider will consider your health, age, and other factors when deciding what is normal for you.
To understand what your test results mean, your provider will consider your symptoms, medical history, and the results of other tests. That's why it's best to ask your provider what your test results say about your health. In general:
High phosphate/phosphorous levels in your urine may mean you have:
Kidney disease that affects your kidneys' ability to hold on to phosphate.
Hyperparathyroidism, a condition in which your parathyroid gland produces too much parathyroid hormone.
Low phosphate/phosphorous levels in your urine may mean you have:
Kidney disease that affects your kidneys' ability to get rid of extra phosphate.
Hypoparathyroidism, a condition in which your parathyroid gland produces too little parathyroid hormone.
If your phosphate/phosphorous levels are not normal, it doesn't always mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Eating a meal high in phosphorous or using laxatives with sodium phosphate can affect your results. A laxative is a medicine that can help you have a bowel movement (poop). Also, children often have higher phosphate levels because their bones are still growing. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.
