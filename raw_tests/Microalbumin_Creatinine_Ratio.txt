If your microalbumin creatinine ratio shows an abnormal amount of albumin in your urine, you will likely need more tests to confirm your results. That's because temporary increases in albumin levels may be caused by exercise, certain medicines, fever, and inflammation in the body.
Usually, you will have two more tests during the three to six months after your first test. If two out of three tests show abnormal levels of albumin in your urine, you may have early-stage kidney disease.
Higher or increasing amounts of albumin in your urine usually mean you have:
More serious kidney disease that's likely to get worse faster.
A higher risk for developing problems with your heart and blood vessels (vascular diseases).
If you have higher-than-normal amounts of albumin in your urine, you may need to be tested more often.
Smaller amounts of albumin in your urine don't always mean you have kidney disease. Other conditions that cause inflammation may increase albumin in urine, including:
Urinary tract infections.
Gum infections (periodontitis).
Hepatitis.
Your test results may also be affected by your muscle density and your diet, age, and race.
If you have an abnormal result, your provider will usually order other kidney tests, including a blood test called an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) test. Talk with your provider about what your test results mean. If you're diagnosed with early kidney disease, there are steps you can take to reduce the amount of albumin in your urine and protect your health.
