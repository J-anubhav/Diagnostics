A food challenge test is the only food allergy test that can confirm a diagnosis of a food allergy. If you have other tests, your or your child's allergist will use your test results along with your symptoms and medical history to make a diagnosis.
If the allergist diagnoses a food allergy, the treatment is to avoid the food that trigger your symptoms. There is no cure for food allergies. Avoiding trigger foods involves carefully reading food labels. You'll also need to explain the allergy to anyone who may prepare or serve food to you or your child, including friends, waiters, babysitters, and teachers.
Your allergist will tell you how to manage a mild allergic reaction. In case you or your child has a severe allergic reaction, your allergist may prescribe an autoinjector. An autoinjector is a small device that you use to inject an emergency allergy medicine, called epinephrine. If you need to use the device, it's still very important to get medical help right away even if you feel better. Your allergist will explain when and how to use an autoinjector.
If you have questions about test results and/or how to manage allergic reactions, talk with your allergist.
