Your results may show your provider where the problem is or what type of dysphagia you might have. These can include:
Oral cavity dysphagia, a disorder of the mouth in which you have difficulty chewing or breaking down food. Causes may include:
Weakness after a stroke
Muscular or nerve problems
Oropharyngeal dysphagia, a disorder of the throat in which you have difficulty starting to swallow. Causes may include:
Certain types of cancer
Neurologic diseases such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease
Pharyngoesophageal diverticulum, a small pouch that forms and collects food particles in your throat
Esophageal dysphagia, a disorder of the esophagus in which you have difficulty moving food down your esophagus. Causes may include:
Esophageal stricture (narrowing of your esophagus)
Esophageal cancer
GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), a condition in which the contents of your stomach leak backward into your esophagus
A bedside swallow screen or other type of dysphagia screening tool will only show if you are at risk for one of the above disorders. If your results show you are at risk, your provider will probably order follow-up testing.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your provider. They may also consider your symptoms and medical history to understand your test results.
