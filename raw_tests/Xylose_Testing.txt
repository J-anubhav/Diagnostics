High levels of xylose are normal. It means that your intestines are absorbing the xylose. If your results are high, that may mean that your symptoms are not caused by malabsorption.
If your results showed lower-than-normal levels of xylose in the blood or urine, it may mean you have a malabsorption disorder, such as:
Celiac disease, a chronic (long-lasting) digestive and immune disorder that damages your small intestine. It is triggered by foods that contain gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and other grains.
Crohn's disease, a chronic condition that causes inflammation in your digestive tract.
Whipple disease, a rare condition that prevents the small intestine from allowing nutrients to pass into the rest of the body.
Lower-than-normal levels may also be caused by an infection from a parasite, such as:
Hookworm
Giardiasis
If your xylose blood levels were normal but urine levels were low, it may be a sign of kidney disease and/or malabsorption.
You may need more tests before your provider can make a diagnosis. To understand the results of your xylose testing, your provider may consider your symptoms, medical history, and the results of other tests.
Talk to your provider if you have questions about your or your child's results.
