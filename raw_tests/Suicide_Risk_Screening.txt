If the results of your physical exam or blood, lab, or imaging test show a physical disorder or a problem with a medicine, your provider may provide treatment and change or adjust your medicines as needed.
The results of a suicide risk assessment tool or suicide risk assessment scale can show how likely it is you will attempt suicide. Your treatment will depend on your risk level. If you are at very high risk, you may be admitted to a hospital. If your risk is more moderate, your provider may recommend one or more of the following:
Brief interventions such as safety planning and follow-up phone calls. A safety plan includes lists of coping skills and people you can call when you need help, as well as a plan on how to keep you away from objects you could use to harm yourself.
Psychological counseling (talk therapy) from a mental health professional. There are different types of talk therapy which may be used, including family therapy.
Medicines, such as antidepressants. However, younger people on antidepressants should be closely monitored. These medicines sometimes increase suicide risk in children and young adults.
Treatment for substance use disorder (if needed).
