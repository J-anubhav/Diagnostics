If you are diagnosed with depression, your provider will discuss your treatment options. Starting treatment as soon as possible may improve your chance of recovery. Treatment for depression may take time to work, but it can help reduce symptoms and shorten how long depression lasts.
Your provider may suggest that you see a mental health provider for your care. A mental health provider is a health care professional who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health problems. If you are already seeing a mental health provider, a depression test may help guide your treatment.
