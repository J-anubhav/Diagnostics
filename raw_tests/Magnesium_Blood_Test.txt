If the results of your magnesium blood test are abnormal, your provider will use your medical history and the results of other tests to diagnose the cause. Many different conditions can affect magnesium levels, so ask your provider to explain what your test results mean.
In general, low magnesium levels may mean that:
You're not getting enough magnesium in your diet. Older adults and people with alcohol use disorder or malnutrition are more likely to have this problem.
Your body isn't able absorb magnesium, even if you eat the right amount. Causes of this problem include digestive disorders, such as Crohn's disease, or taking certain medicines.
Your body is getting rid of too much magnesium. Causes include kidney problems, long-term diarrhea, and diabetes, which can cause frequent urination (peeing) if blood glucose levels are too high.
Other health conditions linked to low magnesium include underactive parathyroid glands and pregnancy, which increases the need for magnesium.
Higher than normal magnesium levels may mean that:
You're getting too much magnesium from dietary supplements, laxatives, antacids, or certain prescription medicines. It's rare to get too much magnesium from food alone.
Your body has a problem getting rid of magnesium. The most common cause is kidney failure.
Other health conditions linked to high magnesium include dehydration, hypothyroidism, Addison disease, and overactive parathyroid glands.
Treatment for abnormal magnesium levels will depend on your condition.
