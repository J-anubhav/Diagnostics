Your sputum sample will be put in a dish with a special substance that allows bacteria to grow. It usually takes a few days to get the results of your sputum culture, but it may take weeks. How long it takes to get your results will depend on the type of bacteria that you are being tested for, since some types of bacteria take longer to grow in the lab
If your results were normal, it means that no harmful bacteria or fungi were found.
If your results were not normal, it may mean you have some kind of bacterial or fungal infection. Your provider may need to do more tests to find the specific type of infection you have. The most common types of harmful bacteria found in a sputum culture include those that cause:
Pneumonia
Bronchitis
Tuberculosis
An abnormal sputum culture result may also mean a flare-up of a chronic condition, such as cystic fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is a lung disease that makes it hard to breathe.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your provider. To understand the results of your sputum culture, your provider will consider your symptoms, medical history, and the results of other tests.
