Normal vitamin E levels vary with age. Your test results should say if your results are normal for your age.
Low vitamin E levels mean you are not getting or absorbing enough vitamin E. Your health care provider will use your medical history and the results from other tests to diagnose the cause. You can usually treat vitamin E deficiency by taking vitamin supplements and treating any conditions that may be blocking absorption.
High vitamin E levels mean you are getting too much vitamin E. If you have been taking vitamin E supplements, you will need to stop. If vitamin E has caused problems with bleeding, your provider may also prescribe medicines to treat you.
