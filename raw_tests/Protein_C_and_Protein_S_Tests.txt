Higher than normal levels of protein C or S are not known to cause any health problems.
Lower than normal levels of protein C or S, or proteins that aren't working well, mean that you have a higher risk of developing a blood clot. Your level of risk depends on how abnormal your test results are.
If your provider thinks your protein C or S deficiency is inherited, you may need a genetic test to find out for sure. Having an inherited deficiency doesn't mean that you'll develop a blood clot. But it does mean that your risk for developing a clot will be increased for the rest of your life.
If your protein C or S deficiency is acquired, the deficiency may be temporary or long-lasting. In certain cases, acquired deficiencies may get worse over time.
With both inherited and acquired deficiencies, treatment may help reduce your risk of developing blood clots. Your provider may recommend treatment depending on your test results and health history. You may be able to lower your risk of blood clots by:
Taking medicines (blood thinners, also called "anticoagulants") to help prevent too much clotting.
Treating the condition that caused an acquired deficiency.
Avoiding other things that can increase your risk of blood clots, including smoking and birth control pills.
If you have questions about your results or how to manage a protein C or S deficiency, talk with your provider.
