The results of hearing tests show if your hearing is normal or if you have hearing loss. You'll usually get your results right after your tests are done.
If you have hearing loss, the results will show how severe it is, which ear is affected more, and whether you have conductive, sensorineural, or both types of hearing loss:
With conductive hearing loss, your provider may be able to treat the cause and restore your hearing. Your treatment will depend on what's blocking sound from reaching your inner ear. It may include removing wax, draining fluid, or surgery to fix problems with your eardrum or ear bones.
With sensorineural hearing loss, your hearing loss can't be treated, but you may be able to use hearing aids or have surgery to implant a device to improve your hearing. If your hearing can't be improved, assistive devices are available to help with daily living. For example, there are devices to help you use the phone and to alert you to doorbells, alarms, and other sounds.
In certain cases, more tests may be needed to diagnose the cause of the hearing loss.  If you have questions about your test results, talk with your health care provider.
