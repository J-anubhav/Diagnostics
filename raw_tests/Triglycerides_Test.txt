Triglycerides are usually measured in milligrams (mg) of triglycerides per deciliter (dL) of blood.  The commonly used guidelines for normal and higher levels of triglycerides in adults are:
Category
Triglyceride levels in adults

Healthy
less than 150mg/dL
Borderline high
150 to 199 mg/dL
High
200 to 499 mg/dL
Very high
500 mg/dL and higher

Guidelines for children and teens are different than adults. Ask your child's provider to explain what your child's test results mean.
Triglyceride levels that are higher than normal may mean you have a higher risk of heart disease, stroke, and other conditions that affect your arteries. Having high blood triglycerides also increases your risk of metabolic syndrome. Very high triglyceride levels increase your risk of sudden pancreatitis.
To lower your blood triglycerides, your provider may recommend lifestyle changes, such as:
Eating heart-healthy foods and limiting added sugar and foods high in saturated fat
Getting regular physical activity
Aiming for a healthy weight
Managing stress
Quitting smoking
Getting enough sleep
Limiting alcohol
In certain cases, you may also need medicine to help lower your triglyceride levels. Before making any major changes to your diet or exercise routine, talk with your provider about what treatment is best for you.
Triglyceride levels that are too low are very uncommon.
