Your test results may be a specific number or listed as a "small," "moderate," or "large" amount of ketones. Normal results can vary depending on your diet, activity level, and other factors.
Because high ketone levels can cause serious health problems, be sure to talk with your provider about what is normal for you and what your results mean.
