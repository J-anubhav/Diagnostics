--- CONTENT ---
A testosterone level test alone can't diagnose any health conditions, but abnormal results with symptoms may be a sign of a health problem.
In males, low T levels may be caused by different conditions, including:

Problems with the testicles (the part of the male reproductive system that makes sperm), which are the main producers of testosterone in males.
Chronic (long-lasting) diseases such as liver, or kidney disease.
A pituitary gland disorder.
Benign tumors (not cancer).
Injury to the testicles.
Alcohol use disorder (AUD).
Certain genetic diseases such as Klinefelter syndrome.


In females low T levels are normal, but extremely low levels may be a sign of:

An adrenal gland disorder.
A pituitary gland disorder.
A disorder of the ovaries (the part of the female reproductive system that makes eggs).


In males, high T levels may be caused by:

A tumor in the testicles.
Steroid use.
An adrenal gland disorder, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).


In females, high T levels may be caused by:

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
Ovarian cancer or other problems with the ovaries.
An adrenal gland disorder, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).
A disorder of the pituitary gland.
Your test results may mean different things depending on which test was done, your age, your symptoms, the results of other tests, and other conditions you may have. If your results are not normal, it doesn't always mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. It's normal for testosterone levels to decrease with age. If you have questions about your results, talk to your provider.
