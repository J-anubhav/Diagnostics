The meaning of your test results will depend on which test you had, the results of other tests, and your medical history. Ask your provider what your test results say about your health.

An overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism)
A problem with your pancreas, including pancreatitis
Stress from surgery, very serious illness, or trauma
A problem with your adrenal glands, including Cushing's syndrome and pheochromocytoma
Certain medicines
If you have diabetes, glucose levels that are lower than normal for you may be caused by:
Certain diabetes medicines and other medicines that may lower blood glucose
Not eating enough, especially after taking diabetes medicine
Being more physically active than usual
If you don't have diabetes, low blood glucose levels aren't common. If they happen, they may be caused by:
Liver or kidney disease
Underactive adrenal glands, for example, Addison disease
