If your test results aren't normal, you may have glaucoma or a high risk for developing glaucoma.
If your eye care specialist diagnoses glaucoma, your treatment will depend on the type of condition you have. Treatment won't cure the disease or restore any vision you have already lost. But it can prevent more vision loss. Your eye care specialist may recommend one or more treatments, such as:
Medicines to lower eye pressure or reduce the amount of fluid your eye makes.
Eye surgery or laser therapy to improve fluid drainage from the eye.
If an optometrist examined your eyes, you may be referred to an ophthalmologist for more testing and/or treatment.
You will probably have more glaucoma testing to see if the treatment is helping. Ask your eye care specialist to explain your test results and be sure to find out how often you should have your eyes checked.
