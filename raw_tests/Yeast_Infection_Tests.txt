If your results show that you have a yeast infection, your provider may recommend a prescription or over-the-counter antifungal medicine. Antifungal medicines come in many forms for different types of infections, including pills, vaginal creams and suppositories, skin creams, powders, and lotions. Your provider will tell you which treatment is best for you.
It's important to take all your medicine as prescribed, even if you feel better before you finish it. Many yeast infections get better after a few days or weeks of treatment, but certain fungal infections may need treatment for several months or longer before they clear up completely.
