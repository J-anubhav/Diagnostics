A positive test result means a fungus was found in your sample. You most likely have a fungal infection. Your test results will usually identify the specific type of fungus causing the infection.
Sometimes another test is done on your sample to help find out which type of medicine will kill the fungus or stop it from growing.
A negative test result means that no fungi were found in your sample. Something else is probably causing your infection.
If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.
