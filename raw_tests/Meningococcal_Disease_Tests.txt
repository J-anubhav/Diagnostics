The results will show whether you have meningococcal disease.
A positive result means that meningococcal bacteria (Neisseria meningitidis) were found in your blood or CSF sample. You most likely have meningococcal disease.
A negative result means that no meningococcal bacteria were found in your blood or CSF sample. Most likely, your symptoms are not caused by meningococcal disease.
If your provider thinks you have meningococcal disease, you will get treatment with antibiotics. Ideally treatment will begin less than 24 hours after your diagnosis is confirmed.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your provider.
