Your results will show how effective different antibiotics were in killing the bacteria or fungus causing your infection. Results are usually described in one of the following ways:
Susceptible. The tested antibiotic stopped the growth or killed the bacteria or fungus causing your infection, so it may be a good choice for treatment.
Intermediate. The antibiotic may work at a higher dose, or you may need to take the dose more often.
Resistant. The antibiotic did not stop the growth or kill the bacteria or fungus causing the infection. It would not be a good choice for treatment.
If your results are resistant to all of the medicines, you may need to take a few medicines that may work better together.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your provider.
