The results of an RF test alone cannot diagnose a condition. However, your provider can use these results, along with your medical history and the results of other tests, to determine if you have rheumatoid arthritis or any other condition that causes high RF levels. Generally, your results will be either positive or negative.
A negative (normal) result means that you have little or no rheumatoid factor in your blood. But that doesn't rule out rheumatoid arthritis or another health problem. If you have symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, but your RF test results are normal, your provider may order more tests to make a diagnosis.
A positive (abnormal) result means that a higher level of rheumatoid factor was found in your blood. Your provider will also consider other test results along with your symptoms and medical history to find out if you have:
Rheumatoid arthritis or another autoimmune disease.
A chronic infection.
Certain cancers.
Sometimes, rather than a negative or positive result, your results may tell you how much RF was in the sample. Your results may also give a normal range for RF for that laboratory.
Generally, the higher your RF levels, the more likely it is that you have a condition linked to rheumatoid factors. However, people with rheumatoid arthritis can have little or no rheumatoid factor. Similarly, people without rheumatoid arthritis can have a lot of RF in their blood. Your provider may refer you to a rheumatologist (a provider who specializes in autoimmune disorders, including RF) to get more testing if your results are inconclusive.
