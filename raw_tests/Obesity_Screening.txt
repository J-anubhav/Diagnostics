If an obesity screening shows that you have obesity or are overweight, your provider will work with you to develop a treatment plan. The goal of the plan is to reduce your risk of health problems linked to extra body fat.
Your plan will depend on how much weight you need to lose and the cause of your weight gain. Most plans are likely to include lifestyle changes, such as:
Eating a healthier, lower calorie diet
Getting more exercise
Getting enough good-quality sleep
Depending on your BMI and health, you provider may also suggest:
Support from a dietary or nutritional counselor
A behavioral weight-loss treatment program
Prescription weight-loss medicines combined with lifestyle changes
Weight loss surgery or devices, such as balloons, that are put in the stomach to help you lose weight
If you have questions about obesity screening or treatments to lower your BMI, talk with your provider.
