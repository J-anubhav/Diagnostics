Your results will depend on which antibodies were measured. Results may be given as titers (levels of antibodies), positive (you have antibodies), or negative (you do not have antibodies).
Common results for antibody serology tests that look for endogenous antibodies include:
Antibodies to a specific pathogen were found. This may mean you had an infection before. It could also mean you've been vaccinated against a certain disease.
Low levels of certain antibodies were found. This may mean an earlier vaccination does not provide you with enough protection against a disease. It also means you may need a booster shot.
While antibody serology tests can show that you have an immune response to a pathogen, they cannot show if you have full protection from it or how long that protection lasts.
Results for antibody serology tests that look for monoclonal antibodies depend on the type of treatment you are receiving. Talk to your provider about what these results mean.
