Blood sodium levels that are too high or too low can be a sign of many different conditions. To make a diagnosis, your provider will usually look at the results of your sodium blood test with the results of other tests, such as measurements of other electrolytes.
Sodium blood test results that are higher than normal may be a sign of a condition such as:
Dehydration, which may be caused by not drinking enough, diarrhea, or taking diuretic medicines (water pills)
A disorder of the adrenal glands
A kidney disease
Diabetes insipidus (uncommon)
Sodium blood test results that are lower than normal may be a sign of a condition, such as:
A loss of sodium from diarrhea or vomiting
A condition that may cause the body to hold onto extra fluid (which dilutes sodium), including:


Kidney diseases
Cirrhosis of the liver
Heart failure
Certain brain and lung diseases
Certain types of cancer
Certain medicines, including many over-the-counter pain relievers and some antidepressants


Addison disease
Malnutrition
If your results are not in the normal range, it doesn't always mean that you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Certain medicines, your age, sex, and certain medical conditions can increase or decrease your sodium levels. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.
