What the AMH test results mean depends on the reason the test was done:
If you're healthy and trying to get pregnant, ask your provider to explain what your AMH test results mean for your fertility based on your age and other test results. In general, a high level of AMH means you have more eggs available, and a low level means your egg supply is shrinking and your time to get pregnant may be shorter.
If you were tested for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a high level of AMH is a sign that you may have the disease. An AMH test alone cannot diagnose PCOS. There is no cure for PCOS, but symptoms can be managed with medications and/or lifestyle changes.
If you were tested for menopause, low AMH may mean you're getting close to menopause. But AMH test results can't predict how long you have until menopause. If your test result showed no AMH in your blood, it means you are in menopause. If you're younger than age 40 and have symptoms of menopause, an AMH level that's lower than average for your age may be a sign of primary ovarian insufficiency.
If you are being treated for ovarian cancer, a decrease in AMH usually mean that your treatment is working. If AMH increases, it may mean your treatment isn't working or cancer has returned.
If a male baby or child is tested for undescended testicles:
Normal AMH levels mean the baby has working testicles, but they are not in the right location. This condition can be treated with surgery and/or hormone therapy.
Little or no AMH may mean the testicles are not working or missing completely. This may be caused by a change (mutation) in the AMH gene. The baby may have atypical internal female reproductive organs with normal male genitals.
If a baby is tested because of genitals that aren't clearly male or female, the meaning of AMH test results depends on the results of other tests.
If you have questions about test results, talk with your provider.
