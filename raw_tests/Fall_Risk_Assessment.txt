The results may show you have a low, moderate, or high risk of falling. They also may show which areas may be increasing your risk for falls (e.g., gait, strength, and/or balance). Based on your results, your provider may make recommendations to reduce your risk of falling. They may include:
Exercising to improve your strength and balance. You may be given instructions on specific exercises or be referred to a physical therapist.
Changing or reducing the dose of medicines that may be affecting your gait or balance. Some medicines have side effects that cause dizziness, drowsiness, or confusion.
Taking vitamin D to strengthen your bones.
Getting your vision checked by an eye doctor.
Switching to safer footwear to lower your risk of falling.
Getting a referral to a podiatrist (foot doctor) if you are having problems with balance or gait.
Getting rid of any safety hazards in your home. These may include poor lighting, loose rugs, and/or cords on the floor.
Treating any medical conditions that could increase your risk of falls.
If you have questions about your results and/or recommendations, talk to your provider.
