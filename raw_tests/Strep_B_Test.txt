If you are pregnant and results show you have GBS bacteria, you will be given antibiotics intravenously (by IV) during labor, at least four hours before delivery. This will prevent you from passing the bacteria to your baby. Taking antibiotics earlier in your pregnancy is not effective, because the bacteria can grow back very quickly. It's also more effective to take antibiotics through your vein (by IV), rather than by mouth.
You may not need antibiotics if you are having a planned cesarean delivery (C-section). During a cesarean delivery, a baby is delivered through the mother's abdomen rather than vaginally. But you still should be tested during pregnancy because you may go into labor before your scheduled cesarean delivery.
If your baby's results show a GBS infection, he or she will be treated with antibiotics. If your provider suspects a GBS infection, he or she may treat your baby before test results are available. This is because GBS can cause serious illness or death.
If you have questions about your results or your baby's results, talk to your provider.
