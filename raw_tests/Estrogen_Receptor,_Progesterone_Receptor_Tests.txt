The results will show whether you have a hormone receptor-positive or negative type of cancer.
If your hormone receptor status is positive:
At least 1% of the cells in your sample have estrogen and/or progesterone receptors.
The cancer is using either estrogen or progesterone to grow. The higher the levels of receptors, the more effective certain medicines may be in treating your cancer.
These results may also be called hormone-sensitive, hormone receptor-positive, or HR-positive.
If your hormone receptor status is negative:
Less than 1% of the cells in your sample have receptors, so those medicines will not be effective.
These results may also be called hormone insensitive, receptor-negative, or HR-negative.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your provider. They may want to do other tests before making a diagnosis and planning the best treatment for you.
