Synovial fluid is usually light yellow, clear, and a little sticky or stringy. Abnormal synovial fluid may be cloudy and thicker or thinner than normal.
If your results show your synovial fluid was not normal, it may be a sign of one of the following conditions:
A type of arthritis, such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or gout
A bleeding disorder
A bacterial infection
Your specific results will depend on what abnormalities were found. If you have questions about your results, talk to your provider.
To understand the results of a synovial fluid analysis, your provider will consider your symptoms, medical history, and the results of other tests.
