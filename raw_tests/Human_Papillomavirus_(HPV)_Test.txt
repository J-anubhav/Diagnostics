Negative/Normal HPV test results mean that high-risk HPV was not found in your sample. Your provider will let you know when you should be tested again.
Positive/Abnormal HPV test results mean that DNA from a high-risk HPV were found in your sample.
A positive test result does not mean you have precancer or cancer or that you will get cancer. It does mean that you have an HPV infection, which increases your risk for getting cervical precancer or cancer in the future.
There's no treatment for an HPV infection. So, the next steps will depend on your risk for developing cervical precancer or cancer. To estimate your risk, your provider will consider past test results, your age, and other health conditions you have or have had.
Your provider may suggest a colposcopy to check your cervical cells in greater detail. To do this procedure, your provider will use a lighted, magnifying device called a colposcope. They will place the device at the opening of your vagina. The device magnifies the normal view, allowing your provider to see problems that can't be seen by the eyes alone. You may also need more frequent HPV tests or HPV/Pap cotests.
