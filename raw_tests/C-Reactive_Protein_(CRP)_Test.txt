In general, healthy people have very low amounts of CRP in their blood. A value of 0.8-1.0 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or lower is thought to be a healthy amount. Any increases above normal may mean you have inflammation in your body. However, increases can also be linked to:
Insomnia.
Depression.
Hormone replacement therapy.
Obesity.
Sex. Females often have slightly higher CRP levels than males.
Your CRP test results tell you how much inflammation you have in your body, but not what's causing it or where it is. To make a diagnosis, your provider will look at your CRP results along with the results of other tests, your symptoms, and medical history.
