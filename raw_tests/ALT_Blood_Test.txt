An ALT blood test is often done as part of a group of liver function tests. Liver function tests measure several different proteins, substances, and enzymes that show how well your liver is working. Your provider usually compares your ALT results with the results of the other liver tests to evaluate your liver health and decide if you need other tests to make a diagnosis.
Lower-than-usual levels of ALT in your blood are not common. Your provider may do more tests since this may be a sign of:
B6 deficiency
Chronic kidney disease
Higher-than-usual levels of ALT in your blood may be a sign of liver damage from:
Hepatitis
Infection
Cirrhosis
Liver cancer
Other liver diseases
A lack of blood flow to the liver
Certain medicines, such as cholesterol or pain medicines
Poisons
If your results show you have a high level of ALT, it doesn't always mean that you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Many things can affect your results, such as your age, sex, weight, and certain medicines and dietary supplements. Your ALT levels can also be affected by intense exercise and where you are in your menstrual cycle.
To learn what your results mean, talk with your provider.
