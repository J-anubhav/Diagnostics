Your results will show the amount of chymotrypsin in your stool. Your results may also include the amount of trypsin found.
A positive result means that your stool sample shows a normal amount of chymotrypsin and, if it was tested for, trypsin.
A negative result means that the amount of chymotrypsin and/or trypsin in your stool sample is below normal. It may mean that you have pancreatic insufficiency.
If you have a negative result, this doesn’t diagnose any specific disorders by itself. Your provider will need to order more tests. These may include the following, which measure different pancreatic enzymes:
Stool elastase
Lipase blood test
Amylase blood test
If you have questions about your results, talk to your provider.
