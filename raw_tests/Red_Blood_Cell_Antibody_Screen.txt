If you are getting a blood transfusion:
A positive result means you have one or more RBC antibodies in your blood that could destroy red blood cells in certain types of donor blood. You will likely need more tests to find out exactly what type of RBC antibodies you have so your provider can select donor blood that's a good match for you.
A negative result means no RBC antibodies were found.
If you are pregnant:
A positive test result means that you have RBC antibodies in your blood that could harm your fetus. You will likely need more tests to find out what type of RBC antibodies you have.

If you have Rh antibodies, you may have more frequent tests during your pregnancy. There is no treatment to stop your body from making more Rh antibodies.
If you have other RBC antibodies, but no Rh antibodies, your pregnancy will be closely watched. If you are Rh-negative, your provider may give you an injection (shot) to prevent your body from making Rh antibodies.


A negative result means that no RBC antibodies were found. If you are Rh-negative, your provider may give you an injection to prevent your body from making Rh antibodies.
If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.
