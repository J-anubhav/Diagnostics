If your Doppler ultrasound results are normal, it means that the blood vessels that were checked looked healthy. They have no narrowing or blood clots. The blood flow was normal.
If your results aren't normal, the meaning will depend on what area of your body was tested and the type of Doppler ultrasound that you had. Talk with your provider about what your results say about your health and need for treatment.
