Your cognitive test result will be a score.
If your test score is normal, you could still have some cognitive impairment that the test may not show. If you or your family are concerned about your brain function, but your test results were normal, talk with your provider about having another type of cognitive test.
If your score is lower than normal, it usually means you have some level of cognitive impairment. But your provider can't make a diagnosis on these test results alone.
Depending on your score, your provider may have you see a neurologist (a doctor with special training diagnosing and treating problems with the brain and nervous system). The neurologist may do longer tests called "neuropsychological testing" to learn more about how your brain is working. These detailed tests check your ability to plan, solve problems, and make decisions.
Your provider may also order tests to confirm or rule out treatable conditions that could be causing cognitive impairment. Which tests you have will depend on your medical history, a physical exam, and the results of cognitive testing. You may be tested for treatable conditions such as:
Blood vessel disorders
Sleep disorders
Hypothyroidism
Lack of certain vitamins, such as vitamin B12, or minerals
Mental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety, or stress
Concussion or other head injury from an accident or fall
Stroke
Urinary tract infection (UTI)
If you have cognitive impairment that can't be cured, medicines and healthy lifestyle changes may help slow the loss of brain function over time.
If you have questions or are concerned about your results, talk with your provider.
