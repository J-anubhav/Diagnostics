To understand what your test results mean, your provider will consider your aldosterone (ALD) levels along with the results of other tests. Ask your provider to explain what your results say about your health.
In general, higher than normal amounts of ALD may mean you have:
Primary aldosteronism (also called Conn syndrome). This disorder is usually caused by a benign (not cancerous) tumor on an adrenal gland that produces extra ALD.
Secondary aldosteronism. This means that your adrenal glands are healthy, but another medical condition is causing them to make too much ALD. Conditions that can cause high ALD levels include:


Kidney disease
Cirrhosis of the liver
Heart failure
Preeclampsia, a type of high blood pressure that that happens in pregnancy
Dehydration
In general, lower than normal amounts of ALD may mean you have:
Addison disease (also called adrenal insufficiency). With this condition, damage to your adrenal glands causes low ALD. The damage may be from conditions, such as:


An immune disorder (most common cause)
Certain infections
Cancer cells in the adrenal glands


Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). This is a group of genetic disorders you're born with.
Secondary adrenal insufficiency. This condition starts with a problem in your pituitary, a gland at the base of your brain that controls your adrenal glands.
Tertiary adrenal insufficiency. With this condition, low ALD levels are caused by a problem in your hypothalamus, a gland that tells your pituitary when to signal your adrenal glands to make hormones. The most common cause is suddenly stopping steroid medicines after taking them for a long time. Steroids can cause hormonal changes that make your adrenal glands shut down. When you stop taking the steroids, your adrenal glands may be slow to start working again.
Liddle syndrome. This is an inherited condition that causes high blood pressure.
Low levels of ALD may also be linked to:
Certain other health conditions, such as diabetes and lead poisoning
Certain medicines, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, and some heart failure medicines
If you have questions about your results and treatment options, talk with your provider.
