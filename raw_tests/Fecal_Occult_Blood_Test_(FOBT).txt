If your results from a fecal occult blood test show that you have blood in your stool, it means you likely have bleeding somewhere in your digestive tract. But that doesn't always mean you have cancer. Other conditions that may cause blood in your stool include ulcers, hemorrhoids, polyps, and benign (not cancer) tumors.
If you have blood in your stool, your provider will likely recommend more tests to figure out the exact location and cause of your bleeding. The most common follow-up test is a colonoscopy. If you have questions about your test results, talk with your provider.
