Your provider will consider the results of your ANCA test along with your symptoms and the results of other tests. Ask your provider to explain what your test results mean.
If you were tested for autoimmune vasculitis:
A negative result means that no ANCAs were found in your blood sample. Your symptoms probably aren't caused by autoimmune vasculitis.
A positive result means that ANCAs were found in your blood sample. This may mean you have autoimmune vasculitis. Your test results will also show which type of ANCAs were found. This can help diagnose the type of vasculitis you have.
If ANCA antibodies are found, another test may be done on your blood sample to see how much ANCA is in your blood. You will often need other blood tests and a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. A biopsy is a procedure that removes a small sample of tissue or cells for testing. The tissue sample will be taken from a blood vessel that is swollen.
If you were tested to monitor treatment for autoimmune vasculitis, ANCA test results may show whether your treatment is working. But this test isn't always an accurate way to measure how much disease you have.
If you were tested for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), your provider will consider your ANCA test results along with the results from another antibody blood test. This test checks for an antibody called ASCA (anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies). ASCA are common in people with IBD.  You may have:
Ulcerative colitis if ANCA was found, but ASCA was not found.
Crohn's disease if ANCA was not found, but ASCA was found.
If neither antibody was found, you may still have IBD.
If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.
