To understand the results of a panic disorder test, your provider will consider your symptoms, medical history, and the results of other tests. Symptoms of panic disorder often begin before age 25 but may occur in the mid-30s and include:
Frequent, unexpected panic attacks
Ongoing worry about having another panic attack
Avoiding places and situations because you're worried that they may cause a panic attack
Fear of losing control
No other cause of a panic attack, such as substance use, a mental health condition or physical condition
Treatment for panic disorder usually includes one or more of the following:
Talk therapy, also called psychotherapy or counseling, to help you understand your feelings.
Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), a type of talk therapy that helps you change negative thoughts or how you react to things that cause you to feel anxiety.
Mental health counseling.
Anti-anxiety, antidepressant or other medicines.
Your provider may also urge you to practice other healthy habits to reduce panic attacks. These may include avoiding alcohol, reducing caffeine, eating regular meals, and getting enough sleep and exercise. They may also recommend that you join a support group.
