If it takes 20 minutes or more for your finger temperature to return to normal after the ice water bath, it probably means you have Raynaud phenomenon. If your symptoms are severe and/or you are age 35 or older, you may have secondary Raynaud phenomenon.
If your health care provider thinks you have secondary Raynaud phenomenon, they may order more tests to help diagnose the disorder that is causing it. These tests can include:
Nailfold capillaroscopy. For this test, your provider will place a drop of oil on the base of one of your fingernails. The nail area is then examined under a microscope. If abnormal arteries are seen, it can be a sign of scleroderma or other connective tissue disease.
Blood tests to check for immune system disorders. These include an antinuclear antibody (ANA) test, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your provider.
