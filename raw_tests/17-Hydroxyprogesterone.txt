The results of a 17-OHP test help show whether you or your child have the most common type of CAH, which is caused by a lack of 21-hydroxylase.
If test results show a normal amount of 17-OHP, it means that you or your child probably do not have CAH with 21-hydroxylase deficiency. If you or your child has symptoms, the provider may order other tests to figure out the cause.
If test results show higher than normal levels of 17-OHP, you or your child probably has CAH. The provider may order other tests to learn more about how CAH is affecting you or your child.
If you or your child is being treated for CAH, decreasing levels of 17-OHP over time means that the treatment is working. Treatment for CAH may include medicines to replace the cortisol your body can't make. Other medicines may also be needed, depending on the type of CAH. If a girl is born with atypical external genitals, surgery may also be done.
If you, your child, or another family member has been diagnosed with CAH, you may want to talk with a genetic counselor. Genetic counselors are trained in genetics and genetic testing. They can help you learn how likely you are to pass CAH to future children.
If you have questions about the results of a 17-OHP test, talk with your provider.
