If the results of any part of your neurological exam are not normal, your provider will probably order more tests to help make a diagnosis. The tests will depend on what type of condition your provider thinks you could have. They may include:
Blood and/or urine tests
Imaging tests, such as an MRI
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing, also called a lumbar puncture
Biopsy
Electroencephalography (EEG) or electromyography (EMG), which use small electric sensors to measure brain activity and nerve function
If you have questions about your results, talk with your neurologist or other provider.
