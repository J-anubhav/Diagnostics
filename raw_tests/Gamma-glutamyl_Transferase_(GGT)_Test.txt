If your results show higher-than-normal levels of GGT, it may be a sign of liver damage. The damage may be due to one of the following conditions:
Hepatitis.
Cirrhosis.
Alcohol use disorder (AUD).
Pancreatitis.
Diabetes.
Heart failure.
Side effects of a medicine. Certain medicines can cause liver damage in some people.
The results can't tell you which condition is causing your liver damage, but they can help show how much damage there is. Usually, the higher the level of GGT, the more liver damage you have.
If your results show low or normal levels of GGT, you probably don't have liver disease.
Your results may also be compared with the results of an ALP test. ALP tests help diagnose bone disorders. Together, your results may show one of the following:
High levels of ALP and high levels of GGT mean your symptoms are likely due to a liver disorder and not a bone disorder.
High levels of ALP and low or normal GGT levels mean it's more likely you have a bone disorder.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your provider. Your provider will consider your symptoms, medical history, and the results of other blood tests to understand the results of your GGT test.
