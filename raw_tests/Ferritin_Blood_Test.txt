Lower than normal ferritin levels may mean you have iron deficiency anemia, or another condition related to low iron levels. Iron deficiency anemia is a common type of anemia where your body doesn't make enough red blood cells. Without treatment, it can lead to heart problems, infections, slow growth and brain development in children, and other health issues.
Higher than normal ferritin levels can be caused by having too much iron in your body. Other conditions that may cause increased ferritin levels include:
Inflammation (like from infection or surgery)
An autoimmune disorder
Liver disease
Cancer
Obesity
Alcohol use disorder
Hyperthyroidism
If your ferritin results are not normal, it does not always mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Certain medicines can decrease or increase your ferritin levels. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.
