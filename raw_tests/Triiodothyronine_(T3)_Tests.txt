To understand the results of your T3 test, your provider will usually compare them with the results of your TSH and T4 tests. Like T3, T4 tests may measure either free or total T4, but providers usually measure free T4.
Your provider will look for different combinations of high, low, and normal results. Each combination suggests a different thyroid condition. Ask your provider to explain what your test results say about your health.
In general:
Normal T3 levels (free or total) alone do not rule out thyroid disease. But if your TSH and free T4 levels are also normal, you probably don't have a thyroid condition.
High T3 levels (free or total) may mean you have hyperthyroidism (too much thyroid hormone).
High T3 levels with:


Low TSH and high free T4 levels may mean that a problem with your thyroid gland is causing too much thyroid hormone.
Normal or high TSH and high free T4 levels may mean that a pituitary gland condition is causing too much thyroid hormone.


Low T3 levels (free or total) may mean hypothyroidism (too little thyroid hormone).
Low or normal T3 levels with:


High TSH levels and low free T4 levels may mean that a problem with your thyroid gland is causing too little thyroid hormone.
Low TSH and low free T4 levels may mean that a pituitary gland condition is causing too little thyroid hormone.
If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.
