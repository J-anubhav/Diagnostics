If your AAT blood levels are low, it may mean you have AAT deficiency. To confirm the diagnosis, you'll need a genotype or phenotype test.
If that testing shows that you have AAT deficiency, your provider may recommend additional testing to evaluate your lung and liver function.
There is no cure for AAT deficiency. But treatments can help prevent your condition from getting worse. Your exact treatment will depend on your symptoms.
You can also take steps to stay as healthy as possible, including:
Not smoking. If you are a smoker, quit smoking. If you don't smoke, don't start. Smoking is the leading risk factor for life-threatening lung disease in people with AAT deficiency.
Not drinking alcohol. Alcohol can damage your liver.
Following a healthy diet.
Getting regular exercise.
Seeing your provider regularly.
Taking medicines as prescribed by your provider.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your provider.
