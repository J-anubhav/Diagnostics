If your screening shows you may have postpartum depression, it's important to get treatment as soon as possible. You may need treatment from a mental health provider. A mental health provider is a health care professional who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health problems. They may treat you using:
Counseling (also called talk therapy).
Medicine, such as antidepressants. If you are breastfeeding your baby, let your provider know. This may affect what medicines your provider can give you.
A mental health provider may also follow-up with you throughout your treatment to monitor your progress.
Along with these treatment options, there are things you can do at home that may help you feel better, such as:
Asking for help caring for the baby and doing other household chores.
Spending time with other adults.
Taking time for yourself.
Getting some physical activity, such as walking.
Resting when the baby rests.
Joining a support group for new moms.
In the most serious cases, when symptoms don't respond to medicine or any other treatment, your provider may use brain stimulation therapies, such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), also called "shock therapy."
