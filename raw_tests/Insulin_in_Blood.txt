To understand what your insulin test results mean, your provider will consider your medical history and results of other tests, including a blood glucose test. For example:
If your insulin level is high and your blood glucose is normal or a little above normal for you, you may have insulin resistance.
If your insulin level is high or normal and your blood glucose is low for you, you may have hypoglycemia from too much insulin. Possible causes include:

A pancreatic tumor (insulinoma)
Cushing's syndrome
Taking too much insulin for diabetes


If your insulin level is low and your blood glucose is high for you, it may mean that your pancreas can't make enough insulin. Possible causes include type 1 diabetes and pancreatitis.
There are other possible causes of abnormal levels of insulin and glucose. Ask your provider to explain what your test results say about your health.
