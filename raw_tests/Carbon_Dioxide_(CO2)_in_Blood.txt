Abnormal test results may be a sign that your body is having a hard time keeping the right acid-base balance (pH balance). This may be because your lungs or kidneys are having a problem removing carbon dioxide or because you have an electrolyte imbalance. Many different types of conditions can cause these problems.
Too much CO2 in the blood (called hypercapnia or hypercarbia) can be a sign of many conditions, including:
Lung diseases.
Cushing's syndrome.
Kidney failure.
Metabolic alkalosis, a condition in which your blood is not acidic enough. You may lose acid from conditions such as vomiting, dehydration, and anorexia.
Too little CO2 in the blood (hypocarbia) may be a sign of:
Addison disease.
Diabetic ketoacidosis, a complication of type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
Shock.
Metabolic acidosis, a condition in which your blood is too acidic. It can have many causes, including kidney or liver disease or long-lasting diarrhea.
Respiratory alkalosis, a condition in which your blood is not acidic enough because of a lung or breathing problem, including hyperventilation (rapid, deep breathing).
If your test results are not in the normal range, it doesn't necessarily mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Your provider may order other tests to confirm a diagnosis. Other factors, including certain medicines, can affect the level of CO2 in your blood. To learn what your results mean, talk with your provider.
