Your provider will review your CA-125 test results along with other information about your condition. Together, you can discuss how your results affect your diagnosis, treatment, and need for more testing.
In general:
If you are being treated for ovarian cancer, and the results of several tests show that your CA-125 levels are going down, it usually means that the treatment is helping.  If your levels go up or stay the same over time, it may mean that the treatment isn't working.
If you have finished your treatment for ovarian cancer and your CA-125 levels begin to increase over time, your cancer may be coming back.
If you have a high risk for ovarian cancer or have a suspicious pelvic lump, high CA-125 levels could be a sign of cancer. Your provider will usually order more tests to make a diagnosis.
While high CA-125 levels don't always mean ovarian cancer, a normal CA-125 test result doesn't rule  it out. That's because CA-125 levels may be low in the early stages of cancer. And not everyone with ovarian cancer makes high levels of CA-125.
Talk with your provider if you have questions about your results.
