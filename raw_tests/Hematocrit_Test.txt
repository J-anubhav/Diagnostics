Your hematocrit test results are reported as a number. That number is the percentage of your blood that's made up of red blood cells. For example, if your hematocrit test result is 42, it means that 42% of your blood is red blood cells, and the rest is made up of white blood cells, platelets, and blood plasma.
Normal hematocrit levels will vary, depending on your sex, age, whether or not you smoke, and the altitude where you live. Ask your provider what your hematocrit level should be.
A lower-than-normal hematocrit level may be a sign that:
You have had blood loss due to a recent injury
You have a condition causing chronic (long-term) blood loss
Your body doesn't have enough red blood cells (anemia). There are many types of anemia, and they can be caused by different medical conditions.
Your body is making too many white blood cells, which may be caused by:

Bone marrow disease
Certain cancers, including leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, or cancers that spread to your bone marrow from other parts of the body
A higher-than-normal hematocrit level may be a sign that:
Your body is making too many red blood cells, which may be caused by:

Lung disease
Congenital heart disease
Heart failure
Polycythemia


Your blood plasma level is too low, which may be caused by:

Dehydration, the most common cause of a high hematocrit
Shock
If your results are not in the normal range, it doesn't always mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Living at high altitudes with less oxygen in the air may cause a high hematocrit. That's because your body responds to low oxygen levels by making more red blood cells to give you the oxygen you need.
Pregnancy can cause a low hematocrit. That's because your body has more fluid than usual during pregnancy, which decreases the percentage that's made of red blood cells.
