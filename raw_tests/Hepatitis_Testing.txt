Different labs report hepatitis test results in various ways, so it's best to ask your provider what your test results mean.
In general:
A negative or normal result means you probably don't have a hepatitis infection. But if you know you were exposed to hepatitis, you may need to be tested again later on.
A positive or abnormal result may mean:

You have an active hepatitis infection now. It may be an acute infection or one you've had for a long time.
You had a hepatitis infection in the past that cleared up.
An abnormal test result means that signs of hepatitis were found in your blood. These signs include:
Hepatitis antigens, which are substances in the hepatitis virus that trigger your immune system to fight the virus. If you have hepatitis antigens in your blood, it means that you may have an active hepatitis infection. It could be an acute or chronic infection.
Hepatitis antibodies, which are proteins that your immune system makes to help fight a hepatitis infection. If you have hepatitis antibodies in your blood, it may mean that you have an acute or chronic infection or that you had an infection in the past.
If your test results are abnormal, you will likely need other tests to find out if you have an active infection and whether it is an acute or chronic infection. For example, if your test results suggest a hepatitis B infection, your provider may use a type of test called a triple panel that checks your blood for:
Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg), an antigen on the surface of the hepatitis B virus.
Hepatitis B Surface-Antibody (Anti-HBs), an antibody that your immune system makes to fight HBV after a hepatitis B infection or vaccination.
 Anti-HBc, another antibody that your immune system makes to fight HBV, but only after a hepatitis B infection.
If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.
