The results of a lactate test can only show whether you have abnormal levels of lactate. They can't tell what's causing the problem.
A high level of lactate in a blood sample usually means you have either hyperlactatemia or lactic acidosis:
Hyperlactatemia means your level of lactate is staying mildly or moderately high, but the acidity of your blood (pH) is still within a normal range. If lactate continues to build up, hyperlactatemia can become lactic acidosis.
Lactic acidosis means that your lactate level is high enough to make your blood is too acidic, and it is staying high. Lactic acidosis is more serious than hyperlactatemia and needs to be treated right away.
Treatment for high levels of lactate depends on the condition that's causing the lactate to build up in your blood. Your provider will consider your symptoms, medical history, and the results of other tests to diagnose the cause.
If you had a lactate test using cerebrospinal fluid:
High levels of lactate mean you probably have bacterial meningitis.
Normal or slightly high levels of lactate mean you probably have viral meningitis.
Low levels of lactate are rare and not considered to be a medical concern.
If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.
