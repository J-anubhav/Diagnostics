Results are often reported as a general amount, such as "few," moderate," or "many" cells. A normal result is typically "few" cells.
"Moderate" or "many" cells may be a sign of a medical condition, such as:
Urinary tract infection
Yeast infection
Kidney disease
Liver disease
Certain types of cancer
If your results are not normal, it doesn't always mean that you have a medical condition that needs treatment. You may need more tests before your provider can make a diagnosis. To learn what your results mean, talk with your provider.
