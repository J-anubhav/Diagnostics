If your screening test results are negative (normal), it means you probably don't have a syphilis infection. However, it doesn't completely rule out the possibility. Antibodies can take a couple of weeks to develop. So, you may need another screening test if you think you were exposed to syphilis. Your provider can tell you whether you need another test.
If your screening test results are positive, it means you have antibodies that may be from a syphilis infection. Your provider will likely order a second test to confirm whether or not you have syphilis.
If your follow-up test confirms you have syphilis, you will probably be treated with penicillin, a type of antibiotic. Antibiotic treatment cures most early-stage syphilis infections. Later-stage syphilis is also treated with antibiotics, but this treatment can't undo any damage that the syphilis caused.
If you have questions about your test results, or about syphilis, talk to your provider.
