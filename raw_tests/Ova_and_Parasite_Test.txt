A negative or normal test result means that no parasites or eggs were found in your stool sample. This may mean:
You don't have parasites.
There were not enough parasites in your sample to show up in a test.
Your provider may order another test and/or different tests to help find out what's causing your symptoms.
A positive or abnormal test result means that parasites and/or eggs were found in your stool sample. You have intestinal parasites. The results will also show the type of parasites you have and how many were in your sample.
Treatment for an intestinal parasite infection will depend on the type of parasite you have and your general health. Treatment may include medicines that get rid of the parasites and/or relieve symptoms. You will also need to drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration (the loss of too much fluid from your body) from the diarrhea and vomiting.
You may be told not to swim until all your symptoms have been gone for at least two weeks. That can help make sure you don't spread parasites to others.
If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.
