If you have an HIV viral load test because you have HIV:
A negative or undetectable viral load means that you have so little HIV in your blood that the test can't find it. This means that your HIV medicines are working well to protect your immune system, and you are unlikely to spread HIV through sex. It does not mean you're cured. You must continue to take your medicines as prescribed to keep your HIV in control.
A low viral load means your medicine is stopping the virus from growing and your infection is unlikely to get worse.
A high viral load means the virus is growing and your treatment is not working well. The higher the viral load, the more risk you have for infections and diseases related to a weak immune system. It may also mean you have a higher risk for developing AIDS. If your results show a high viral load, your provider will probably change your medicines.
If you had an HIV viral load test to diagnose whether you have HIV:
A normal or negative result means that no HIV was found in your blood, and you are probably not infected with HIV.
A result that shows any amount of virus in your blood means you have an HIV infection. Your provider will likely order other tests, including a CD4 count, to see how much HIV has damaged your immune system.
If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.
