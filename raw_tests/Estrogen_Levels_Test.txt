A healthy level of estrogen depends on several factors, including:
Your age.
Your sex.
The reasons for having the test.
The type of estrogen that was measured.
The results of other tests you may have had.
Estrogen levels in males, for example, don't change much throughout life. Therefore, a high level is usually a sign of a health condition such as infertility or an estrogen-producing tumor.
In females, however, estrogen levels change a lot. They rise during puberty, are at their highest during pregnancy, and decline after menopause. Because estrogen levels change so often, you may need to be tested more than once to look for a trend in your estrogen levels over time. Talk with your provider to find out what your results mean for your health.
