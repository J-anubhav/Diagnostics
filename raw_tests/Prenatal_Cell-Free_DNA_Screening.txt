If your results were negative, it's unlikely that your baby has Down syndrome or another trisomy disorder.
If your results were positive, it means there is an increased risk that your baby has one of these disorders. But it can't tell you for sure if your baby is affected. To confirm a diagnosis, you'll need other tests, such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS):
Amniocentesis. This test takes a sample of the amniotic fluid that surrounds the unborn baby in the uterus. The fluid contains cells from the baby that can be tested. The test is usually done between the weeks 15 and 20 of pregnancy.
Chorionic villus sampling (CVS). A CVS collects tissue from parts of the placenta called the chorionic villi. The placenta is the organ that grows in the uterus to provide nutrients and oxygen to the baby. Cells from the chorionic villi usually have the same chromosomes as the unborn baby. A CVS may be done between weeks 10 and 13 of pregnancy.
These tests are usually very safe procedures, but they do have a slight risk of causing a miscarriage.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your provider and/or a genetic counselor.
