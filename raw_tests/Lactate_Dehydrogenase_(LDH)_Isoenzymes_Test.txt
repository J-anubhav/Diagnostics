The meaning of your LDH isoenzyme test results depends on the reason you had the test, your symptoms, and the results of other tests you've had. Ask your provider to explain what your results say about your health.
In general, a high level of one or more LDH isoenzymes usually means you have some type of tissue damage. The type of disease or damage depends on which LDH isoenzymes are high and how your isoenzyme levels compare with each other. For example:
LDH-1 that's higher than LDH-2 may be a sign of a certain type of anemia.
LDH-5 that's higher than LDH-4 may be a sign of liver damage or disease.
High levels of two or more isoenzymes may mean you have two different conditions. Or it could be a sign of cancer that has spread to different tissues.
Higher than normal LDH isoenzyme levels don't always mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. High levels of certain LDH isoenzymes can be caused by intense exercise and certain medicines, including aspirin. It's also possible to have high LDH isoenzymes if many red blood cells broke open when your sample was collected and tested.
Lower than normal LDH isoenzyme levels aren't common and usually aren't considered to be a health problem. Your levels of certain isoenzymes may be affected by taking large amounts of vitamin C or vitamin E. There is also a rare genetic disorder that can cause low LDH levels.
If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.
