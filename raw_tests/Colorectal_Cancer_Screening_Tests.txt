If your fecal occult blood test or stool DNA test had abnormal results, it doesn't necessarily mean you have cancer. But your provider will probably order more tests, such as a colonoscopy, to help make a diagnosis.
Abnormal results for the other types of screening tests may include the following:
Colonoscopy
Colorectal polyps or abnormal tissue were found and removed.
Samples were sent to a lab for testing.
Most polyps aren't cancerous but can turn into cancer if not removed. Depending on the size and number of polyps, your provider may recommend more frequent colonoscopies.
Sigmoidoscopy
Colorectal polyps or abnormal tissue were found. They may or may not be removed depending on their location.
Whether or not your polyps were removed, you will probably need a colonoscopy so your provider can view your entire colon and rectum.
Virtual colonoscopy
Colorectal polyps or abnormal tissue were seen on the CT scan.
You may need a traditional colonoscopy so your provider can get a tissue sample. Sometimes this procedure can be done on the same day as your virtual colonoscopy.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your provider.
