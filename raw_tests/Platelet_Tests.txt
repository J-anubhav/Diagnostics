If your results show a lower-than-normal platelet count (thrombocytopenia), it may be a sign of:
A cancer that affects the blood, such as leukemia or lymphoma.
A viral infection, such as mononucleosis, hepatitis, or measles.
An autoimmune disease. This is a type of disease that causes your body to attack its own healthy tissues, which can include platelets.
Infection or damage to your bone marrow.
Cirrhosis.
Vitamin B12 deficiency (not enough).
Gestational thrombocytopenia. A common, but mild, low-platelet condition that can occur during pregnancy. It is not known to cause any harm to the mother or  fetus. It usually gets better on its own during pregnancy or after birth.
If your results show a higher-than-normal platelet count (thrombocytosis), it may be a sign of:
Certain types of cancer, such as lung cancer or breast cancer
Anemia
Inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis
Rheumatoid arthritis
A viral or bacterial infection
Severe blood loss
If your platelet function test results were not normal, it may be a sign of an inherited or acquired platelet disorder:
Inherited disorders are passed down from your family. These conditions are present at birth, but you may not have symptoms until you are older.
Acquired disorders are not present at birth. They may be caused by other diseases, medicines, or environmental exposure. Sometimes, the cause is unknown.
Inherited platelet disorders include:
Von Willebrand disease, a genetic disorder that reduces the production of platelets or causes the platelets to work less effectively. It can cause excess bleeding.
Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a disorder that affects platelets' ability to clump together.
Bernard-Soulier syndrome, another disorder that affects platelets' ability to clump together.
Storage pool disease, a condition that affects platelets' ability to release substances that help platelets clump together.
Acquired platelet disorders may be due to chronic diseases such as:
Kidney failure
Certain types of leukemia
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a disease of the bone marrow
Your provider may consider your symptoms, medical history, and the results of other blood tests to understand the results of your platelet tests.
