To understand the results of a burn evaluation, a provider will also consider the part of the body that's burned, the cause of the burn, and the health of the person with the burn. All of this information helps decide whether a burn is minor, moderate, or severe.
The seriousness of the burn guides treatment decisions.  Your provider can explain whether a burn is minor, moderate, or severe and why.
In general:
Minor burns usually don't require hospitalization and they heal well. They involve only first and/or second-degree burns. But they may still be very painful. They can also make it hard to do normal activities for a few days.
Moderate burns may require a stay in the hospital, but they usually don't need treatment in a burn center. They involve only first and/or second-degree burns that cover a larger area than minor burns. With treatment, they usually heal well.
Severe burns require special care at a burn center. Treatment at a burn center may be recommended for:

Second-degree burns that cover more than 10% of the body
Third-degree burns
Second and third-degree burns of the face, feet, hands, genitals, or over the joints, such as the knees
Burns that happen with other injuries, such as broken bones
Burns in people who have other medical conditions that could affect their recovery, such as diabetes or heart disease
Chemical burns and burns from electricity, including lightning
Inhalation injuries that may be caused by breathing in smoke, hot gasses from a fire, or other substances that can burn your mouth, airway, or lungs.
If you have questions about the results of a burn evaluation and/or burn treatment, talk with your provider.
