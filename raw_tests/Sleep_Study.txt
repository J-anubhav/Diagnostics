Your results may include measurements of the following:
Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI). This looks at how many episodes of sleep apnea happen in a night. If you have more than five episodes, it probably means you have sleep apnea.
Sleep efficiency. This is a calculation based on the total number of minutes you sleep during the night compared with the amount of time you spend in bed. So if you spend a long time in bed without being able to sleep, you would have low sleep efficiency.
Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI). This measures the number of times your oxygen level drops during sleep. Lower than 90 percent oxygen is considered abnormal.
Heart rate. A normal heart rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. This result will show if your heart is beating faster or slower than normal.
Your provider will review all the results and, if appropriate, provide a treatment plan. If you have questions about your results, talk to your provider.
