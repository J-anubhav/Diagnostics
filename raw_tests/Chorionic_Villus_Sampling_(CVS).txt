CVS test results are usually available within two weeks.
If your CVS test results were normal, it is unlikely that your baby has the disorder that was tested. But it does not guarantee that your baby won't have any health problems.
If your results were not normal, it may mean your baby has a chromosome or genetic disorder, such as Down syndrome or cystic fibrosis.
Occasionally, CVS test results are unclear, and your provider may recommend amniocentesis. Amniocentesis is another prenatal diagnostic test that checks the amniotic fluid (the liquid in the sac surrounding the baby). It is performed between the 15th and 20th week of pregnancy.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your provider.
