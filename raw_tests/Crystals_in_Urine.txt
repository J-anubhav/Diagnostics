The test results will usually show if you have any crystals in your urine, the amount, and what they are made of. It's best to ask your provider to explain what your results mean. That's because different types of crystals are linked to different medical conditions, and your provider may need to order other tests to make a diagnosis.
Some common types of crystals that may form stones in some people include:
Calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate. These crystals are the most common cause of kidney stones.
Uric acid and urates. Large amounts of these crystals may form when metabolic problems, such as gout and type 2 diabetes, make your urine too acidic.
Struvite. Repeated urinary tract infections may cause large amounts of struvite crystals.
Having crystals in your urine doesn't always mean that you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Large amounts of some types of crystals may be caused by:
Certain medicines, such as calcium-based antacids, some types of antibiotics, diuretics (water pills), and antiviral medicines (medicines that treat viruses)
Your diet, especially eating too much animal protein, such as fish, shellfish,  and organ meats
Not drinking enough fluids
If you have questions about your test results and how you can prevent crystals in urine, talk with your provider.
