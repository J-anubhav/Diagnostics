A positive Zika test result means you probably have a Zika infection.
A negative result can mean that you aren't infected or that you were tested too soon for the virus to show up in testing. If you think you were exposed to the virus, talk to your provider about when or if you need to be retested.
If you are diagnosed with Zika and are pregnant, you can start to prepare for your baby's possible health problems before they are born. While Zika exposure doesn't always cause birth defects or health problems, many children born with Zika have long-lasting special needs. Talk to your provider about how to get support and health care services should you need them. Early intervention may make a difference in your child's health and quality of life.
If you are diagnosed with Zika and are not pregnant, but would like to become pregnant in the future, talk to your provider. They can tell you how long you should wait before trying to have a baby and if you need to be retested.
