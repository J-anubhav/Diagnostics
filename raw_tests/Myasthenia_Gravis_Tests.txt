If one or more of the tests show that you have MG, your provider will work with you on a treatment plan. Treatments can help reduce your symptoms and improve muscle weakness. The treatment options may include:
Medicines. Different medicines are used to help improve muscle strength and/or decrease your body's immune system responses.
Plasmapheresis (plasma exchange) and intravenous (IV) immunoglobin. These procedures remove abnormal antibodies from your blood. They are usually only used in severe cases. They can help with your symptoms for a few weeks or months.
Surgery. Your provider may recommend surgical removal of your thymus gland, which is often abnormal in people with MG. The procedure can reduce symptoms, even in people without thymus tumors.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your provider.
