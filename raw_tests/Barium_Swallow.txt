Ulcers
Tumors
Polyps
Diverticula, a condition in which small sacs form in the inner wall of the intestine
Esophageal stricture, a narrowing of the esophagus that can make it hard to swallow
If you have questions about your results, talk to your provider. Your provider may consider your symptoms, medical history, and the results of other tests to understand the results of your barium swallow.
