Typical results may show one of the following:
Negative: You probably don't have celiac disease.
Positive: You probably do have celiac disease.
Uncertain or indeterminate: It's unclear whether you have celiac disease.
If your results were positive or uncertain, your provider may order other tests to confirm that you have celiac disease and/or to see how much damage the disease may have caused. These tests may include:
A biopsy to examine a tissue sample from your small intestine or your skin if you have a rash that could be from celiac disease. An endoscopy is used to take a sample of tissue from your small intestine.
Capsule endoscopy to look at your small intestine. For this test, you swallow a tiny camera in a capsule. As it passes through your small intestine, it records pictures. The camera leaves your body during a bowel movement (poop).
Genetic testing to see if you have a gene linked to celiac disease.
Tests for other health problems that celiac disease may cause such as anemia, osteoporosis, or a lack of certain vitamins.
