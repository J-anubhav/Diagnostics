Many things can cause blood in urine, and most of them aren't serious. Blood may be caused by certain medicines, intense exercise, sexual activity, or menstruation.
But blood in your urine can sometimes be a sign of a more serious problem, such as:
Infection in your bladder, kidney, or prostate
Bladder or kidney stones
Kidney injury from an accident or sports
A viral infection, including hepatitis (a disease of the liver causing inflammation)
Cancer of the bladder, kidney, or prostate
Enlarged prostate (BPH)
Inflammation of the kidney, urethra, or bladder
A blood disorder
Polycystic kidney disease
Disorders of the ureters (tubes that connect your kidneys to your bladder)
If your test result shows blood in your urine, you may need more tests to find out why. To learn what your results mean, talk with your provider.
