During your colposcopy, your provider may find one or more of the following conditions:
Genital warts
Polyps
Swelling or irritation of the cervix
Abnormal tissue
If your provider also performed a biopsy, your results may show you have:
Precancerous cells in the cervix, vagina, or vulva
An HPV infection
Cancer of the cervix, vagina, or vulva
If your biopsy results were normal, it's unlikely that you have cells in your cervix, vagina, or vulva that are at risk for turning into cancer. But that can change. So, your provider may want to monitor you for cell changes with more frequent Pap smears and/or additional colposcopies.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your provider.
