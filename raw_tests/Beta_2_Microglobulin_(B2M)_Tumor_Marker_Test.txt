If your B2M levels were measured to learn about your cancer:
The higher your B2M levels, the more cancer you have in your body. Higher levels are linked to cancers that tend to grow faster.
If you have multiple myeloma, higher levels of B2M are often linked to kidney problems.
If your B2M levels were measured to check how well your treatment is working, your provider may look at several test results over time to look for a trend:
Increasing B2M levels may mean your treatment is not working.
Decreasing B2M levels may mean your treatment is working.
B2M levels that don't change may mean that your disease is stable and hasn't gotten better or worse.
If you have questions about your test results, talk with your provider.
