If your results show high levels of DHEAS, it may be a sign of the following conditions:
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia, an inherited disorder of the adrenal glands in which the adrenal glands produce too many male sex hormones.
A tumor of the adrenal gland. It may be benign (noncancerous) or cancerous.
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a common hormone disorder affecting childbearing women. It is one of the leading causes of female infertility.
In rare cases, a high level of DHEAS could be a sign of an ovarian tumor.
If your results show low levels of DHEAS, it may be a sign of the following conditions:
Addison disease. Addison disease is a disorder in which the adrenal glands are not able to make enough of certain hormones.
Hypopituitarism, a condition in which the pituitary gland does not make enough of one or more of the pituitary hormones. The possible symptoms will vary, depending on which hormones are lacking.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your provider. To understand the results of a DHEA sulfate test, your provider will consider your symptoms, age, sex, medical history, and the results of other blood tests.
