The provider will usually write up the results of an ADHD screening in a report that includes a diagnosis.  To diagnose ADHD, the screening must find all of these things:
Several symptoms of ADHD that began before age 12.
Several symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that have lasted for at least 6 months and cause serious problems. To be diagnosed with ADHD:

Children up to age 16 must have at least 6 ongoing symptoms.
People 17 and older must have at least 5 ongoing symptoms.


Symptoms that happen in 2 or more settings, for example, at home and at work or school.
Symptoms that clearly get in the way of functioning well at school, work, and/or in social situations.
Symptoms aren't caused by another mental health disorder.
If there is a diagnosis of ADHD, the report will include the type of ADHD (inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive, or combined). It will also say whether ADHD is mild, moderate, or severe. Any other disorders that may have been found will be included in the report.
There's no cure for ADHD, but treatment may help reduce symptoms. Treatment may include medicine, talk therapy, behavioral therapy, and lifestyle changes. Usually, two or more treatments are combined. Parents of children with ADHD may also receive training to help their children manage ADHD.
