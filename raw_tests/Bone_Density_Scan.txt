Bone density results are often given as T-scores and Z-scores. A higher number means that you have greater bone density. The lower your score, the higher your risk of bone fracture.
T-score may be used if you are a postmenopausal woman or a man age 50 or older. This measurement compares your bone density with a healthy young adult of the same sex.
Z-score may be used if you are premenopausal, a male under age 50, or a child. This measurement compares your bone density measurement with other people your age, weight, sex, and ethnic or racial origin.
Your T-score results may show one of the following:
A T-score of -1.0 or higher. This is considered normal bone density.
A T-score between -1.0 and -2.4. This means you have low bone density (osteopenia) and may be at risk for developing osteoporosis.
A T-score of -2.5 or less. This means you probably have osteoporosis.
If your results show you have low bone density, your provider will recommend steps to prevent further bone loss. These may include:
Getting more exercise, with activities such as walking, dancing, and using weight machines.
Adding calcium and vitamin D to your diet.
Taking prescription medicines to increase bone density.
Your provider may recommend how often you need to have repeat scans, based on your risk of bone fractures. The recommendations are to get a central DEXA scan every two years for high risk, every 3 to 5 years for moderate risk, and every 10 to 15 years for low risk.
If you have questions about your results and/or treatments for bone loss, talk to your provider.
