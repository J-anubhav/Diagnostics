Prealbumin levels that are lower than normal may happen with:
Malnutrition
Inflammation
Trauma, such as a burn injury
Serious or long-term illness, such as cancer
Liver disease
Serious infection
Hyperthyroidism
Certain digestive diseases
If you have low prealbumin levels and you are ill, injured, or recovering from surgery, it may be difficult to know exactly what is causing the low levels. Your provider may need to do other tests to find out more about your nutritional health.
Prealbumin levels that are higher than normal may happen with several conditions, including:
Hodgkin disease
Kidney failure
Alcohol use disorder (AUD)
High-dose corticosteroid therapy
Prealbumin testing is not used to diagnose or monitor these conditions. If you have high prealbumin levels, your provider may order other tests to diagnose your condition.
If your prealbumin levels are not normal, it doesn't always mean you have a condition that needs treatment. Certain medicines and pregnancy can affect your prealbumin levels. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.
