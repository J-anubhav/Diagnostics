To understand the results of your iron test, your provider will consider your symptoms, age, medical history, and the results of other blood tests.
If one or more iron test results show your iron levels are too low, it may mean you have:
Iron deficiency anemia, a common type of anemia.
Another type of anemia.
Thalassemia, a blood disorder that is inherited (passed down through families). It causes the body to make fewer than normal healthy red blood cells.
If one or more iron test results show your iron levels are too high, it may mean you have:
Hemochromatosis
Lead poisoning
Liver disease
Most conditions that cause too little or too much iron can be treated with iron supplements (for low iron), changes to your diet, medicines, and/or other therapies.
If your iron test results are not normal, it does not necessarily mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Some medicines, including birth control pills and estrogen treatments, can affect iron levels. Iron levels may also be lower for women during their menstrual cycles.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your provider.
