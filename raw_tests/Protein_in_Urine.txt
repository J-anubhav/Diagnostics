If your result is negative, your urine did not contain too much protein when you were tested.
If a large amount of protein is found in your urine sample, it doesn't always mean you have a medical problem that needs treatment. Your urine protein levels can also be high for a short time because of:
Strenuous exercise
Dehydration
Your diet
Stress
Pregnancy
Your provider may recommend other urinalysis tests to see whether you continue to have a high protein level in your urine over time. If your urine protein remains high, it is likely a sign of kidney disease or kidney damage from other conditions.
The amount of protein in your urine is linked to the amount of kidney damage you may have. But you will need more tests to diagnose what is causing the damage. To learn what your results mean, talk with your provider.
