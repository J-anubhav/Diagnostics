It may take several days or even weeks to get your bone marrow test results. Your provider may have ordered many different types of tests on your sample, so your results often include a lot of complex information. Your provider can explain what your results mean.
In certain cases, if your test results are not normal, you may need to have more tests to confirm a diagnosis or to decide which treatment would be best for you.
If you have already been diagnosed with a disease that involves your bone marrow, your test results may show:
How well your treatment is working
Whether your treatment is causing side effects that affect your bone marrow
