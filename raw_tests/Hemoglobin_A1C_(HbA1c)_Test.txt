A1C results tell you what percentage of your hemoglobin is coated with glucose. The ranges are just a guide to what is normal. What's normal for you depends on your health, age, and other factors. Ask your provider what A1C percentage is healthy for you.
To diagnose diabetes or prediabetes, the percentages commonly used are:
Normal: A1C below 5.7%
Prediabetes: A1C between 5.7% and 6.4%
Diabetes: A1C of 6.5% or higher
Providers often use more than one test to diagnose diabetes. So, if your test result was higher than normal, you may have another A1C test or a different type of diabetes test, usually either a fasting blood glucose test or an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).
If your A1C test was done to monitor your diabetes, talk with your provider about what your test results mean.
