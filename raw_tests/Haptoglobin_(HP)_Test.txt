These tests may be done at the same time or after your haptoglobin test.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your provider. Tell your provider if you are taking any medicines. Some medicines may cause your haptoglobin test results to be higher or lower than normal.
To understand the results of a haptoglobin test, your provider will consider your symptoms, medical history, and the results of other blood tests.
