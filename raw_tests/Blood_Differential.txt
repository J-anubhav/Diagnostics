Your blood differential test results may be higher or lower than normal for many reasons.
Conditions that may cause a high white blood cell count, also called leukocytosis, can include:
Infections
Autoimmune or inflammatory disorders
Leukemia or Hodgkin disease
Allergic reactions
Certain steroids
Conditions that may cause a low white blood cell count, also called leukopenia, can include:
Bone marrow diseases
Chemotherapy
Certain medicines, such as antibiotics
Cancer
HIV
But abnormal results don't always mean you have a condition that needs medical treatment. Some other factors that may affect your results can include:
Physical injury or extreme stress
Smoking
Alcohol use
If your results seem abnormal, your provider may order other tests to help figure out the cause. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider. To understand your results, your provider will also consider your symptoms, medical history, and the results of other blood tests.
