If there are nitrites in your urine, it may mean that you have a UTI. But, even if no nitrites are found, you may still have an infection. That's because some types of bacteria don't change nitrates into nitrites.
Your provider will also look at other results of your urinalysis, especially tests that look for signs of white blood cells in your urine. White blood cells in urine may also mean you have a UTI. To learn what your results mean, talk with your provider.
