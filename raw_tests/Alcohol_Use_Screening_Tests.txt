Some results may show whether you have AUD. Others may show you how severe your AUD may be. For those tests, your results may be in one of the following or similarly named categories:
Mild. You have two to three symptoms of AUD. This pattern of drinking puts your health at risk and/or has harmful social effects on you or others. If you have symptoms now, you may be at risk for more serious problems in the future. Your provider may recommend steps to help you change your drinking habits.
Moderate. You have four or five symptoms of AUD. Your provider may recommend a brief intervention or other treatments.
Severe. You have six or more symptoms of AUD. You may need more intensive treatment. This can include seeing a specialist, medicines, support groups, and/or addiction recovery programs.
