If you have symptoms and your test results show VZV antibodies or the virus itself, it's likely you have chickenpox or shingles. Your diagnosis of either chickenpox or shingles will depend on your age and specific symptoms.
If you don't have symptoms and your results show antibodies to the virus or the virus itself, you either had chickenpox at one point or received the chickenpox vaccine.
If you are diagnosed with an infection and are in a high-risk group, your provider may prescribe antiviral medicines. Early treatment can prevent serious and painful complications.
Most healthy children and adults with chickenpox will recover from chickenpox within a week or two. Home treatment can help relieve symptoms. More serious cases may be treated with antiviral medicines. Shingles may also be treated with antiviral medicines as well as pain relievers.
If you have questions about your results or your child's results, talk to your provider.
