Understanding abnormal liver function test results is often complicated. So, it's best to ask your provider to explain what your results say about your health.
If any of your liver function test results are abnormal, your provider will compare the results of all the substances that were measured. This is done to look for certain patterns of normal and abnormal results that suggest different types of liver conditions.
In general, the results of your liver function tests can tell you if:
Your liver is inflamed, which means you have hepatitis.
You have hepatitis from drinking alcohol or other causes, such as infection.
Your liver isn't working well and how weak it has become.
You have a problem with your bile ducts. Bile is a digestive "juice" that your liver makes. Bile ducts are the tubes that carry bile through your liver and out of your liver.
Medicines are harming your liver and how serious the damage is.
Abnormal results don't always mean you have a problem with your liver. Other conditions can cause high or low levels of certain substances that these tests measure. For example, high levels of ALP can be a sign of bone disease or liver disease. So, your provider will also consider your symptoms, medical history, risk for liver disease, and any medicines you take.
If you have been ill recently, certain types of abnormal results may be temporary. In this case, your provider may repeat the tests later to see if your results return to normal.
