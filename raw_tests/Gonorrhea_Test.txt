A negative (or normal) test result means that a gonorrhea infection wasn't found in your sample. But it doesn't rule out gonorrhea. After you are infected with gonorrhea, it may take weeks before you test positive. So, it's possible that the test was taken too soon after your exposure to the bacteria.
A positive (or abnormal) test result means that you are infected with the gonorrhea bacteria. You will need treatment with antibiotics right away. You will also need to tell your sex partner or partners so that they can be tested and treated if necessary.
To make sure your infection is cured, take all your medicine following your provider's instructions. You should also avoid having sex for at least 7 days and take another test three months after completing treatment. To prevent any future gonorrhea infections, take appropriate precautions whenever having sex. These include:
Having sex with only one partner who has tested negative for STIs and has sex only with you.
Using condoms correctly every time you have sex.
