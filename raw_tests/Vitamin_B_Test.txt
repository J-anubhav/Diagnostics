Your results will show the amount of each B vitamin that was tested. If your vitamin B levels are normal, but you have symptoms, you may need other tests to diagnose your condition.
If you're lacking in one or more B vitamins, you may need other tests to find out why.  Your provider may recommend taking vitamin B supplements. In certain cases, vitamins may be given by intravenous (IV) treatment.
If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.
