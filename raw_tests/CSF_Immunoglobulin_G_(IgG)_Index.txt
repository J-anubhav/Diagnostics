A CSF IgG index that's higher than normal may be a sign of an infection or an inflammatory or autoimmune condition that affects your central nervous system, such as:
Multiple sclerosis
Transverse myelitis (TM)
Syphilis that infects your nervous system (neurosyphilis)
Connective tissue disorders
Guillain-Barre syndrome
Encephalitis caused by herpes simplex
You may need more tests before your provider can diagnose your condition.
A CSF IgG index that's lower than normal may be a sign that your body is unable to make enough IgG antibodies, and you are likely to get sick with infections. Experts don't know what causes this problem. Normally, a test of IgG levels in blood is used to check whether you may lack IgG antibodies.
If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.
