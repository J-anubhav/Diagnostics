Results from an ANA test alone cannot diagnose a specific disease. Your provider will use your ANA test results along with other blood and imaging tests and information about your health to make a diagnosis.
A negative result on an ANA test means that antinuclear antibodies were not found in your blood, and you're less likely to have an autoimmune disorder. But a negative ANA test doesn't completely rule out the possibility that you could have an autoimmune disorder.
A positive result on an ANA test means that antinuclear antibodies were found in your blood. A positive result may be a sign of:
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
A different type of autoimmune disease
A viral infection (antinuclear antibodies from a virus are usually only in your blood for a short time)
Another health condition that can cause antinuclear antibodies, such as cancer
If your ANA test results are positive, your provider will likely order more tests to make a diagnosis.
Having antinuclear antibodies in your blood doesn't always mean you have a disease. Some healthy people have antinuclear antibodies in their blood, and levels tend to increase with age. Many healthy adults may have a positive ANA test result, especially women over the age of 65. Also, certain medicines can cause antinuclear antibodies.
If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.
