The results of your AFP test tell you whether your baby is more or less likely to have certain birth defects and genetic disorders. The test can't diagnose any conditions.
Normal AFP test results mean that it's unlikely that your baby has a problem. But it's possible for a test result to be normal and miss a problem that does exist.
Abnormal AFP results may be a sign that your baby has a problem:
Lower than normal AFP levels may mean your baby has an increased risk of a genetic disorder such as Down syndrome or Edwards syndrome.
Higher than normal AFP levels may mean your baby has an increased risk of:

A neural tube defect, such as:

Spina bifida, a condition in which the bones of the baby's spine don't close around part of the spinal cord. It often causes damage to the spinal cord and nerves.
Anencephaly, a condition in which most of the baby's brain and skull don't develop. Almost all babies with this condition die shortly after birth.


A defect in the abdomen (belly) or esophagus (the tube that carries food from the baby's mouth to the stomach).
Abnormal AFP results don't always mean that your baby has an increased risk of a serious problem. High or low AFP levels may be caused by:
An incorrect due date. AFP levels rise and fall at set times during pregnancy as the baby develops. That means normal levels of AFP are different at different times of your pregnancy. If your due date is wrong, your AFP blood level may seem abnormal when it's just right for how far along you really are in your pregnancy.
Being pregnant with more than one baby. Each baby makes AFP, so your AFP blood levels will be higher with two or more babies.
A false positive result. This means that your AFP results show an increased risk of a problem when there's really nothing wrong with your baby.
If your AFP test results aren't normal, you will likely have more tests to help find out why. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.
