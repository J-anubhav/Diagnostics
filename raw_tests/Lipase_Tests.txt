A very high level of lipase is usually a sign of acute pancreatitis.
Higher than normal levels of lipase may be caused by:
Diseases of the pancreas, including a blocked duct (tube), or pancreatic cancer
Chronic kidney disease
Peptic ulcer
Gallbladder disease
Intestinal problems, such as a blocked intestine
Diabetes
Salivary (spit) gland disorders, such as infection or cancer
Alcohol use disorder (AUD)
Low levels of lipase may be a sign of permanent damage to cells in your pancreas that make lipase. This may happen in certain chronic (long-lasting) diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis.
If your lipase levels are not normal, it doesn't always mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Many medicines, including codeine, diuretics ("water pills"), certain cholesterol medicines, and birth control pills can affect your lipase levels.
If you have questions about your lipase test results, talk with your health care provider.
