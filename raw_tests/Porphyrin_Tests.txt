Porphyria is a rare disease and is hard to diagnose. Many of the symptoms of porphyria are similar to those of other, more common diseases.
If high levels of porphyrin are found in your blood, urine, or stool, your provider will probably order more tests to confirm a diagnosis and to find out what kind of porphyria you have.
While there is no cure for porphyria, the condition can be managed. Certain lifestyle changes and/or medicines can help prevent the symptoms and complications of the disease. Specific treatment depends on the type of porphyria you have. If you have questions about your results or about porphyria, talk to your provider.
