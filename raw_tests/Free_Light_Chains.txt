Your results will show the amounts of lambda and kappa free light chains in your blood. It will also provide a comparison between the two, called a ratio.
If your results were not normal, it may be a sign of a plasma cell disorder, such as:
Multiple myeloma.
Amyloidosis.
MGUS (monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance). This is a condition in which you have abnormal protein levels. It often has no symptoms but sometimes can become multiple myeloma.
Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM), a cancer of the white blood cells. It's a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
You may also have a higher level of free light chains if you have a kidney condition. In this case, a higher level may not mean that you have a plasma cell disorder.
To understand the results of a free light chains test, your provider will consider your symptoms, medical history, and the results of other blood tests.
