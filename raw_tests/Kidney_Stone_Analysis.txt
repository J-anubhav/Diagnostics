Your results will show what your kidney stone is made of. With this information, your provider will be able to recommend steps and/or medicines to help prevent more stones from forming. Your treatment plan will depend on the size, type, and location of the stone. Most plans include drinking plenty of water and changing some of the foods you eat.
If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.
