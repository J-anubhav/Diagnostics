Your sample will be placed on a slide and treated with the Gram stain. A laboratory professional will examine the slide under a microscope. If no bacteria were found, it means you probably don't have a bacterial infection, or there weren't enough bacteria in the sample.
If bacteria were found, certain qualities may help narrow down which types may be causing your illness. This will help your provider decide how to treat it.
If the bacteria was colored purple, it means you likely have a Gram-positive infection.
If the bacteria was colored pink or red, it means you likely have a Gram-negative infection.
Your results will also include information about the shape of the bacteria in your sample. Most bacteria are either round (known as cocci) or rod-shaped (known as bacilli). The shape can provide more information about the type of infection you have.
Your results may not identify the exact type of bacteria in your sample, but they can help your provider figure out what's causing your illness and how best to treat it. You may need more tests, such as a bacteria culture, to confirm what type of bacteria it is.
Gram stain results may also show whether you have a fungal infection. They may show what category of fungal infection you have: yeast or mold. But you may need more tests to find out which specific fungal infection you have.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your provider. Your provider will consider your symptoms, and medical history to understand the results of a Gram stain test. They may also want you to have a physical exam or additional tests.
