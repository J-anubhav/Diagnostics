Your eGFR results may be reported as a number that shows how much blood your kidneys filter per minute. Your test results may also give your creatinine level and/or your cystatin C level.
Ask your provider to explain what your eGFR says about your kidney health. An eGFR isn't a perfect test and may not always reflect kidney damage. It's also possible to have an abnormal result even if you don't have kidney damage.
In general:
A normal eGFR means that you probably don't have kidney disease.
An eGFR that's below normal or low may mean that you may have kidney disease.
A very low eGFR means that you may have kidney failure.
If you're diagnosed with kidney disease, your provider will explain what you can do to protect your kidneys from more damage and help prevent kidney failure.
