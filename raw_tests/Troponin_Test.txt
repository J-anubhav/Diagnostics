To understand the results of a troponin test for chest pain and/or other symptoms of a heart attack, your provider will consider your symptoms, medical history, and the results of other tests.
In general:
If your first troponin test results are normal, you'll probably be retested during the next 12 hours. That's because increased troponin levels usually don't show up for about 2 to 3 hours after a heart attack begins. So, results from a later test may show higher than normal troponin levels. In the meantime, the results of other tests and exams will help your provider know whether to start treatment for a heart attack right away.
If your troponin test results show normal troponin levels 12 hours after your symptoms began, you probably did not have a heart attack.
If your test results show higher than normal amounts of troponin in your blood, it usually means you have some damage in your heart muscle. Your provider will consider all the information about your condition to diagnose whether a heart attack caused the damage. Very high troponin levels most often mean you've had a heart attack.
Higher than normal troponin levels don't always mean you've had a heart attack. They can be caused by unstable angina many other conditions that can damage the heart, including:
Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia), especially a heartbeat that's too fast
Heart failure
Heart valve disease
Infection or inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis)
Heart surgery
Intense exercise over a long time, such as running a marathon
Chest injuries
Chronic kidney disease
A blood clot in your lungs (pulmonary embolism)
Sepsis
A severe COVID-19 infection
If you have high troponin levels, but your provider doesn't think you've had a heart attack, you may have other tests to find the cause.
If you have questions about your test results, talk with your provider.
