An albumin blood test alone cannot diagnose a condition. Your provider will usually consider your albumin test results with the results of other tests to make a diagnosis.
Lower than normal albumin levels in your blood may be a sign of:
Liver disease, including severe cirrhosis, hepatitis, and fatty liver disease
Kidney disease
Malnutrition, especially a lack of protein in your diet
Infection
Digestive diseases that involve problems using protein from food, such as Crohn's disease and malabsorption disorders
Burns over a large area of your body
Thyroid disease
Higher than normal albumin levels in your blood may be a sign of dehydration, which may be caused by severe diarrhea or other conditions.
If your albumin levels are not in the normal range, it doesn't always mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Certain medicines, including steroids, insulin, and hormones, can increase albumin levels. Your albumin levels may be lower than normal if you haven't eaten for 24 to 48 hours, or take certain medicines, including birth control pills. Albumin levels are also lower during pregnancy.
If you have questions about your test results, ask your provider to explain what they mean.
