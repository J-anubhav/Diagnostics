Your provider will usually look at your SHBG blood test results along with the results of a total testosterone test. This helps your provider estimate how much free testosterone is in your blood.
If your SHBG levels are too low, it means that more of your total testosterone is likely free and available for your body to use.
Low levels of SHBG may be related to:
Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid).
Type 2 diabetes or insulin resistance.
Obesity or being very overweight.
Overuse of steroid medicines and/or anabolic steroids.
Cushing's syndrome.
In females, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
It's also normal for SHBG levels to decrease with older age as the production of sex hormones also decreases.
If your SHBG levels are too high, it likely means that less of your total testosterone is available for your tissues to use. So, your tissues may not be getting enough testosterone.
High levels of SHBG may be related to:
Liver disease.
Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid).
Certain eating disorders.
Use of estrogen-containing medicines, such as hormone replacement therapy or birth control pills, in females.
Decreased production of sex hormones in males.
Your provider may order other tests to check if your hormones are in balance with each other. If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.
