High uric acid levels in a blood test may happen if:
Your body makes too much uric acid
Your kidneys can't remove uric acid from your blood
You are eating too many foods that cause high levels of purines such as:

Red meat and organ meats, including liver and kidney
Certain kinds of seafood, including shellfish, anchovies, sardines, trout, and tuna
Alcohol (all types)
High fructose corn syrup in soda and sweets
Your provider may order more tests to help diagnose what's causing the problem. High levels of uric acid may be related to many conditions, including:
Gout
Kidney disease
Leukemia, multiple myeloma, or cancer that has spread in your body (metastatic cancer)
Side effects from certain cancer treatments
Alcohol use disorder
Preeclampsia, a condition that can cause dangerously high blood pressure in pregnant women
Low levels of uric acid in blood are uncommon and usually don't cause health problems. Health conditions that are related to low uric acid levels are usually diagnosed using other tests.
High uric levels in urine, may be related to:
Gout
Kidney stones or having a high risk for kidney stones
Leukemia, multiple myeloma, or cancer that has spread in your body
Obesity
An inherited genetic condition, such as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, that makes it hard for your body to get rid of uric acid
Low levels of uric acid in urine may be related to kidney disease, lead poisoning, or alcohol use disorder.
If your results show a high level of uric acid in your blood or urine, it doesn't always mean you have a condition that needs treatment. Many people have high levels of uric acid without having health problems.
If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider. Medicines and/or changes in your diet may help you keep your uric acid levels in a healthy range.
