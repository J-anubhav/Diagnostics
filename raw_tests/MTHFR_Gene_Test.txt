The results of an MTHFR gene test tell you whether you have one or both of the two most common changes in the MTHFR gene. Test results are usually reported as positive or negative:
A positive test result means that you have an MTHFR gene change in one or both of your MTHFR genes. Having a change in only one of your MTHFR genes is unlikely to cause any health problems. If your homocysteine levels are high and your MTHFR gene test shows that you have:

Two copies of the C677T gene change or one copy each of C677T and A1298C, then these gene changes are probably causing your increased homocysteine levels
Two copies of the A1298C gene change, then your increased homocysteine levels are probably not caused by these gene changes

A negative test result means that neither of the common MTHFR gene changes were found in your blood sample. If you have an increased homocysteine level, it's probably from another condition, such as a lack of B vitamins, taking certain medicines, older age, hypothyroidism, kidney disease, or another disease.
If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.
