The test result can show whether you have ever had a CMV infection. But the tests can't show if it's a current, past, or reactivated infection.
If you have symptoms and/or risk factors such as an immune system disorder, your provider may do additional tests to help make a diagnosis and create a treatment plan.
If you are pregnant and your amniocentesis shows your baby has CMV, your child's provider may test and treat your baby soon after birth to help prevent complications.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your provider or your child's provider.
