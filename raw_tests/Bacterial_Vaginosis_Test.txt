Abnormal results from a vaginal smear or a whiff test mean that you have a bacterial infection.
The results of a vaginal pH test will be a number that shows how acidic your vagina is. A pH over 4.5 is high, which means you're more likely to have BV. But a pH test can't diagnose BV.
If your results show you have a BV infection, your provider will probably prescribe antibiotic pills and/or antibiotic creams or gels that you put in your vagina.  Medicines that treat BV are safe to use during pregnancy.
Sometimes a BV infection will come back after successful treatment. If this happens, your provider may prescribe different medicine or a different dose of the medicine you took before.
There are no over-the-counter treatments for BV. Treatments for vaginal yeast infections will not help BV and could make your symptoms worse. So, don't try to treat an infection yourself.
If your results show you don't have BV, your provider may do more tests to find the cause of your symptoms.
If you have questions about your results, talk with your health care provider.
