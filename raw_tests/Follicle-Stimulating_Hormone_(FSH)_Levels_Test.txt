To understand the results of your FSH test, your provider will consider your sex, age, symptoms, medical history, and the results of other hormone tests, especially your level of luteinizing hormone (LH). Your provider can explain what the results of your FSH test mean.
Generally, in women and men:
Higher levels of FSH are often a sign of a condition in the reproductive glands (ovaries or testicles) that prevents them from making normal levels of sex hormones. The pituitary responds by making more FSH to try to get them to work properly. High FSH may also be a sign of a condition outside of the reproductive glands that affects how the glands work.
Conditions linked to high FSH levels include:

In women:

Ovaries that never developed normally
Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
Menopause or perimenopause
An ovarian tumor
Thyroid diseases or adrenal gland disorders
A chromosomal disorder, such as Turner syndrome


In men:

A germ cell tumor (a tumor that starts in the cells that become sperm)
Mumps
A physical injury to the testicles
A chromosomal disorder, such as Klinefelter syndrome


In women and men, damage to the ovaries or testicles, which may be caused by:


Autoimmune disease

Radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy





Lower than normal levels of FSH in women and men are often a sign of a problem with the pituitary gland or hypothalamus. These problems may make it hard for your body to make FSH and LH.


In women, low FSH levels may also be linked to rapid weight loss, being very underweight, or extreme exercise.
Generally, in children with signs of early sexual development (before age 8 in girls or age 9 in boys):
High levels of FSH and LH mean the child has early puberty, also called precocious puberty. In most cases, the cause is unknown. But in certain cases, the cause is a problem in the brain, such as:


A brain tumor
A past brain injury
A past brain infection, such as meningitis or encephalitis


Normal levels of FSH and LH mean the child has a type of early puberty called peripheral precocious puberty. This often means that a disorder in the testicles, ovaries, or adrenal glands is causing higher than normal levels of estrogen or testosterone. Severe hypothyroidism and exposure to medicines that contain sex hormones may also cause this type of early puberty.
Generally, in teens with no signs of sexual development by age 13 for girls or age 14 for boys, low or normal levels of FSH and LH usually mean delayed puberty. Many teens with delayed puberty are healthy and go through normal puberty at a later age. But delayed puberty may be caused by certain medical conditions, such as:
Poor nutrition from a long-term illness or eating disorder
Hypogonadism, which is when the ovaries or testicles make little or no hormone. It may be caused by:


Certain genetic disorders, including Kallmann syndrome
Tumors in the brain or pituitary gland
Turner syndrome in girls
Klinefelter syndrome in boys
Certain autoimmune disorders
Radiation therapy or chemotherapy
