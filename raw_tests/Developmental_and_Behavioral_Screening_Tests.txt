If the results show that your child is not developing at the same rate as other children of the same age, it doesn't necessarily mean there is a problem. But your child may be referred to a specialist for further testing and treatment.
If you have questions about the results, talk to your child's provider. When deciding on the next steps, your provider may consider the results of the screening tests in combination with your child's health and family history.
