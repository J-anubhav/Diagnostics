Your IVP images will be studied by a diagnostic radiologist. This is a doctor who specializes in examining x-rays, MRIs, and other medical images to diagnose medical conditions. The radiologist will send a report with your IVP results to your provider. The report will explain exactly what the x-rays showed.
In general:
Normal results mean that:

The organs of your urinary tract looked normal, and no blockages were seen.
Your kidneys, ureters, and bladder worked normally to filter the dye and pass it out of your body.
In males, the prostate was the right size, and no problems were seen.


Abnormal results mean that something irregular was found on your IVP images. Ask your provider to explain your report and diagnosis. Examples of abnormal results include:

One or more of urinary tract organs did not appear to be the right size or shape, or it was not in the usual place.
A tumor, stone, cyst, injury, scar, or some other abnormal area of tissue was found and may be blocking the flow of urine.
Your urinary tract did not filter the dye and/or pass it out of your body as quickly or completely as it should.
In males, the prostate was larger than normal.
