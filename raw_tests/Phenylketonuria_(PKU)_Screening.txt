If the results are normal, it means that the amount of Phe in your baby's blood was normal. So, your baby is unlikely to have PKU. But if the test was done sooner than 24 hours after birth, your baby may need to be tested again at 1 to 2 weeks of age.
If both parents know they carry a gene for PKU and your baby's test is normal, the baby should have genetic testing. This blood test will check the baby's genes for changes. The results will diagnose PKU or rule it out for certain. If your baby does have PKU, genetic testing can also help your provider understand how serious the condition is and how best to treat it.
If your baby's results are not normal, it means high levels of Phe were found in your baby's blood. Your baby most likely has PKU. Your provider may order more tests to confirm or rule out PKU. These tests may include more blood tests and/or urine tests.
If your baby is diagnosed with PKU, you can safely give your baby formula that doesn't contain Phe. Breastmilk does contain Phe, so if you would like to breastfeed, talk with your baby's provider to find out if your baby can safely have any amount of breastmilk.
After infancy, people with PKU are generally treated with a special-low protein diet, including some food supplements, to make sure they have proper nutrition.
