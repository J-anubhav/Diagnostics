If your results were not normal, you and/or your baby might get treatment to prevent serious health conditions. Examples of some abnormal results and treatments can include:
Rh incompatibility. You will receive medicine that prevents your body from making the antibodies that may damage your baby's red blood cells.
Infections (hepatitis, STIs, HIV). You will receive medicine to treat the infection. If you have a hepatitis B infection, your baby will get a vaccine within a few hours of birth.
No immunity to rubella. You'll need to avoid anyone who has rubella while you are pregnant. After your baby is born, you should get vaccinated.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your provider.
