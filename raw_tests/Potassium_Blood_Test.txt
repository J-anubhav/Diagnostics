Too much potassium in the blood (hyperkalemia) is often the result of two or more causes, which could include:
Kidney disease. Too much potassium in your blood may mean your kidneys aren't working well.
Addison disease, a disorder of the adrenal glands.
Injuries, burns, or surgery, which can cause your cells to release extra potassium into your blood.
Type 1 diabetes that is not well controlled.
The side effects of certain medicines, such as diuretics ("water pills") or antibiotics.
A diet too high in potassium (not common). Bananas, apricots, green leafy vegetables, avocados, and many other foods are good sources of potassium that are part of a healthy diet. But eating very large amounts of potassium-rich foods or taking potassium supplements can lead to health problems.
Too little potassium in the blood (hypokalemia) may be a sign of:
The side effects of prescription diuretics
Fluid loss from diarrhea, vomiting, or heavy sweating
Using too many laxatives
Adrenal gland disorders, including Cushing's syndrome and aldosteronism
Kidney disease
Alcohol use disorder (AUD)
A diet too low in potassium (not common)
If your test results are not in the normal range, it doesn't always mean that you have a medical condition that needs treatment.
Certain prescription and over-the-counter medicines and supplements may raise your potassium levels.
You should not eat natural black licorice for at least two weeks before your test because it may lower your levels. Most licorice products in the U.S. don't contain natural licorice. But if you eat licorice, check the ingredients label to be sure.
