A negative result means that no signs of parainfluenza viruses were found in your sample. Another illness is probably causing your symptoms. But a negative test result doesn't rule out a parainfluenza illness. It's possible that there was too little virus in your sample for the test to find.
A positive result means that you likely have a parainfluenza infection. But it's possible for a PCR test to show signs of a virus even though you don't have enough virus in your body to make you sick.
