If your test result is normal, it means that you had little to no glucose in your urine. But this doesn't mean that you don't have diabetes. You can have a normal urine glucose level when your blood glucose level is high.
If your test result shows you have too much glucose in your urine, it may be a sign of:
Diabetes (If you have already been diagnosed with diabetes, high urine glucose may mean that your diabetes is not well controlled)
Pregnancy
Gestational diabetes
An uncommon type of kidney disorder
A urine glucose test alone cannot diagnose any conditions. So, if you have an abnormal test result, your provider may order other tests to help make a diagnosis, including blood tests to diagnose or rule out diabetes.
Too much urine glucose doesn't always mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Certain medicines, vitamin C, and eating a large meal may affect your test results. Ask your provider what your test results mean and whether you need a blood glucose test for more accurate results.
