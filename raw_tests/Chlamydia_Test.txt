A negative test result means that you did not have a chlamydia infection when the sample was collected.
A positive test result means you have been infected with chlamydia.
If you have chlamydia, you will need to:
Take antibiotics to treat your infection. Your provider will tell you how to take your medicine. To make sure your infection is cured, follow the instructions carefully and finish all the medicine.
Tell your sexual partner/s that you have chlamydia so that they can be tested and treated if necessary.
Get retested for chlamydia three months after you finish treatment. That's because repeat infections are very common. Ask your provider to tell you how often to get tested after that.
