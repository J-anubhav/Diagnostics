Test results are usually reported as positive or negative:
If you have red bumps or swelling at any testing areas, the test is positive. This means you are probably allergic to those substances. Usually, the larger the reaction, the more likely you are to be allergic.
If you do not have red bumps or swelling at any of the testing areas, the test is negative. This means that you are probably not allergic to those substances.
If you are diagnosed with an allergy, your provider will recommend a treatment plan. The plan may include:
Avoiding the allergen when possible
Medicines
Lifestyle changes such as reducing dust in your home
Your provider will consider your symptoms and medical history to understand the results of an allergy skin test. They may also want to do a physical exam.

If you are at risk for anaphylactic shock, you may need to carry an emergency epinephrine treatment with you at all times. Epinephrine is a drug used to treat severe allergies. It comes in a device called an epinephrine auto-injector that contains a premeasured amount of epinephrine. If you experience symptoms of anaphylactic shock, you should inject the device into your skin and call 911.
