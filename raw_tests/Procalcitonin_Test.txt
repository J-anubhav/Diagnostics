High procalcitonin levels mean that you:
Most likely have sepsis
May have a high risk of developing severe sepsis and septic shock, a life-threatening condition when your organs don't get enough blood to work properly
May have a serious systemic bacterial infection that increases your risk for sepsis
The higher your procalcitonin levels, the higher your risk for sepsis and septic shock.
Moderate to mildly high levels of procalcitonin may be sign of:
The earlier stages of a systemic bacterial infection
Kidney infection, in children only
Conditions other than infections, such as tissue damage from trauma, serious burns, recent surgery, severe heart attack
Slightly high levels of procalcitonin mean that you are unlikely to develop sepsis, but they may be a sign of:
A local bacterial infection, such as a urinary tract infection
An infection from another cause, such as a virus
A systemic bacterial infection that is just beginning
If you are being treated for a bacterial infection, decreasing or low procalcitonin levels mean that your treatment is working.
