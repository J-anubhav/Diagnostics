If your results are not normal, it can be a sign of many different conditions. Depending on which muscles or nerves are affected, it could mean one of the following:
Carpal tunnel syndrome, a common condition that affects nerves in the hand and arm. It causes numbness, tingling, weakness, or pain in your wrist or hand.
Herniated disk, a condition that happens when a part of your spine, called a disk, is damaged. Part of the disk bulges or pushes out, putting pressure on the spine which causes pain and numbness.
Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare disorder that causes your immune system to attack your nerves. It can lead to numbness, tingling, and paralysis.
Myasthenia gravis, a rare disease that causes weakness in the muscles you can control. They may include your muscles for eye movement, facial expressions, or other muscles.
Muscular dystrophy (MD), a group of genetic diseases that cause muscle weakness. This weakness can lead to trouble walking and the ability to care for yourself.
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), a group of nerve disorders that are inherited (passed down through families). CMT causes nerve damage and muscle weakness, mostly in the arms and legs.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. It is a disorder that attacks nerve cells in your brain and spinal cord. It affects all the muscles you use to move, speak, eat, and breathe. There is no cure for ALS, and it gets worse over time.
To understand the results of an EMG test or nerve conduction study, your provider will consider your symptoms, medical history, and the results of other tests.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your provider.
