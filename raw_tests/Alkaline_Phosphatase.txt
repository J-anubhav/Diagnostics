High alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels may be a sign of a liver problem or a bone disorder. Liver problems and bone disorders create different types of ALP. But your ALP test results can't tell which type of ALP is high.
If your test results show high ALP levels, your provider may order other tests to help figure out what's causing the problem. These tests may include:
An ALP isoenzyme test. This test can tell which part of your body is making the ALP. But this test may not be available everywhere.
Liver function tests. If the results of these tests are also high, then your high ALP level is likely from a problem in your liver.
High alkaline phosphatase levels from your liver may be a sign of:
Blockages in your bile ducts
Cirrhosis
Hepatitis
Mononucleosis, which can sometimes cause swelling in the liver
If alkaline phosphatase levels are high and the results of liver tests are normal, the problem may be a bone disorder, such as Paget's disease of bone. This disease makes your bones unusually large and weak, causing them to break more easily.
Moderately high levels of ALP may be a sign of many different types of conditions, including:
Hodgkin lymphoma
Heart failure
Certain infections
It's possible to have higher than normal levels of ALP and not have a medical condition that needs treatment. Your provider will consider your symptoms, medical history, and other test results to make a diagnosis.
Low levels of ALP are less common. They may be a sign of:
Zinc deficiency
Protein deficiency
Malnutrition
Pernicious anemia
Thyroid disease
Wilson disease
Hypophosphatasia, a rare genetic disease that affects bones and teeth
