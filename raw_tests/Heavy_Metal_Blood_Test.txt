Higher than normal levels of a heavy metal in your blood may mean that you have heavy metal poisoning, but not always. Even if you don't have symptoms, you may still need to avoid all exposure to that metal.
Depending on the heavy metal and your condition, you may also need treatment to help your body get rid of the heavy metal as quickly as possible. In certain cases, your provider may recommend chelation therapy. For this therapy, you'll take medicine by mouth or have an injection (shot) of a medicine that helps remove the metals from your body through urine (pee). In certain cases, chelation medicine is given through an IV (intravenous) line.
Chelation therapy can have serious side effects, so it's important to think about the risks and benefits.
Normal or low levels of heavy metal in your blood usually mean that you don't have heavy metal poisoning. However, some heavy metals leave your bloodstream quickly and are stored in your tissues. So, if you have symptoms, your provider will likely order more tests to check for heavy metals in samples of your urine, hair, skin, or fingernail clipping.
Talk with your provider to learn what your results mean.
