The meaning of your results depends on your age, health, the medicines you take, and the results of other tests, such as a blood glucose test. In general:
A high level of C-peptide usually means that your body is making too much insulin. Conditions that cause insulin levels that are high for you include:

Type 2 diabetes.
Cushing's syndrome.
Insulinoma, a tumor in your pancreas.
Kidney failure.
A low level of potassium in your blood.


A low level of C-peptide may mean your body isn't making enough insulin. Conditions that cause insulin levels that are low for you include:

Type 1 diabetes and, in some cases, type 2 diabetes.
Taking too much insulin to treat diabetes, which may block your pancreas from making insulin on its own.
A severe infection.
Addison disease.
Liver disease.
If you have been treated for an insulin-producing tumor in your pancreas, a decrease in your C-peptide levels means your treatment is working. An increase in your C-peptide may mean that your tumor is back.
If you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.
