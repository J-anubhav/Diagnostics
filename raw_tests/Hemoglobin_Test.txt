Your results will compare your hemoglobin level to the normal range, which may be called the reference range. This range may vary, based on the laboratory used and your age, race, and sex. The test can't tell you what's causing an abnormal level. But knowing how high or low your hemoglobin level is can help your provider determine how severe your condition may be.
Your hemoglobin levels may not be in the reference range for many reasons.
Low hemoglobin levels may be a sign of:
Different types of anemia
Thalassemia
Iron deficiency
Liver disease
Cancer and other diseases
Blood loss from injury, a heavy menstrual period, or other problems
Lack of certain nutrients, such as iron or vitamin B-12
High hemoglobin levels may be a sign of:
Lung disease
Heart disease
Polycythemia vera, a disease which causes your bone marrow to make too many red blood cells
Sleep apnea, a disorder that causes you to repeatedly stop breathing during sleep

If any of your levels are abnormal, it doesn't always mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Living at a higher altitude can also cause a high hemoglobin level. Other factors that can affect your results can include:
Diet
Activity level
Certain medicines
Dehydration
Smoking
Certain genetic conditions
Talk with your provider if you have questions about your results. To understand your hemoglobin results, your provider will also consider your symptoms, medical history, and the results of other blood tests.
