If your child's hearing screening test shows normal hearing, your child usually won't need more hearing tests until their next routine screening. But if you have concerns about your child's hearing or if your child has risks for hearing loss, talk with your child's provider about getting more complete hearing tests.
If the results of complete hearing tests show that your child has hearing loss, the results will also show how severe it is, which ear is affected more, and whether they have conductive sensorineural, or both types of hearing loss.
With conductive hearing loss, treatment may be able to restore your child's hearing. The treatment will depend on what's blocking sound from reaching the inner ear. It may include removing wax, draining fluid, or doing surgery to fix problems with the eardrum or ear bones.
With sensorineural hearing loss, the loss of hearing is permanent. But your child's hearing may improve with hearing aids or surgery to implant a device called a cochlear implant.
Other treatment and support options for hearing loss in children include:
Working with professionals who can help children and their families learn to communicate. This may include learning sign language, lip reading, or other ways to communicate.
Education to help your child learn communication skills.
Assistive devices, such as devices for using the telephone and alerting your child to alarms, doorbells, and other sounds.
Support groups.
If you have questions about your child's hearing and treatment, talk with your child's primary care provider or hearing specialist.
