After your dental exam, your dentist will discuss any oral health problems you may have and your treatment options. For certain problems, improving your brushing and flossing habits may be all that's needed.
If you or your child has a cavity or a more serious problem, you'll probably need to make another appointment with the dentist to treat it.
