There are many reasons why your chloride levels may not be in the normal range.
High levels of chloride (hyperchloremia) may be a sign of:
Dehydration.
Kidney disease.
Metabolic acidosis, a condition in which you have too much acid in your blood. It can cause nausea, vomiting, and fatigue.
Low levels of chloride (hypochloremia) may be a sign of:
Heart failure.
Lung disease.
Addison disease, a condition in which your body's adrenal glands don't produce enough of certain types of hormones. It can cause various symptoms, including weakness, dizziness, weight loss, and dehydration.
Metabolic alkalosis, a condition in which you have too much base in your blood. It can cause irritability, muscle twitching, and tingling in the fingers and toes.
If your chloride levels are not in the normal range, it doesn't always mean you have a medical problem that needs treatment. Many things can affect your chloride levels, such as drinking too much fluid or losing fluid because of vomiting or diarrhea. Also, certain medicines, such as antacids, can cause abnormal results. To learn what your results mean, talk with your provider.
