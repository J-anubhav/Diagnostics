Fibroids, polyps, or other abnormal growths were found. Your provider may be able to remove these growths during the procedure. They may also take a biopsy, a tissue sample of the growths, for further testing.
Scar tissue was found in the uterus. This tissue may be removed during the procedure.
The size or shape of the uterus did not look normal.
Openings on one or both fallopian tubes are closed.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your provider.
