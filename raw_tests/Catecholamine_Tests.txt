If your results show high levels of catecholamines in your urine or blood, it may be a sign of a pheochromocytoma, neuroblastoma, or paraganglioma tumor. If you are being treated for one of these tumors, high levels may mean your treatment is not working.
High levels of these hormones don't always mean you have a tumor. Your levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, and/or epinephrine can be affected by stress, vigorous exercise, caffeine, smoking, and alcohol.
To understand the results of your catecholamine test, your provider may consider your symptoms, medical history, and the results of other tests.
If you have questions about your results or your child's results, talk to your provider.
