Your blood test results will show the levels of TCA in your bloodstream. Depending on which TCA you are taking and what the levels are, your provider may adjust your dosage.
There are two types of urine test results. One type will show whether TCA was found but not how much. The other type shows the levels of TCA.
If blood or urine test results show you have dangerously high levels of TCA, you will be treated immediately.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your provider.
