If your results were not normal, it may mean you have one of the following conditions:
Herniated disk
Spinal stenosis
Tumor
Nerve injury
Bone spurs
Arachnoiditis (inflammation of the membrane surrounding the spinal cord)
A normal result means your spinal canal and structures were normal in size, position, and shape. Your provider may want to do more tests to find out what is causing your symptoms.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your provider. To understand the results of myelography, your provider may consider your symptoms, medical history, and the results of other tests.
